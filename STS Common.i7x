Version 1/190507 of STS Common by Andrew Schultz begins here.

[this is a collection of functions common to A Roiling Original and Shuffling Around. It would be too hard at the moment to integrate things back with Trivial Niceties, but maybe I can one day. ]

is-roiling is a truth state that varies.

To process (RL - a rule): [used to avoid Inform giving line breaks when I don't want them]
	(- ProcessRulebook({RL}, 0, true); -)

to rulesOn: [used to turn rules on at the very start of play]
	(- RulesOnSub(); -)

part sitesing

sitesing is an action out of world.

understand the command "sites" as something new.

understand "sites" as sitesing.

carry out sitesing:
	if cur-score of Ordeal Loader is 0:
		say "Last chance spoiler warning. Sure you want to look?";
		if the player yes-consents:
			do nothing;
		else:
			say "Ok. Back to the game." instead;
	say "http://wordsmith.org/anagram/ -- Anu Garg's Rearrangement Server at wordsmith.org was invaluable to me. Hard to believe I've known about it for fifteen years. You've probably seen it before, too, but it's the big one for the main game mechanic. The sayings that go with each anagram have also helped me in many other ways. It's still fun after all these years.[line break]http://www.anagrammy.com/anagrams/faq6.html[line break]http://www.english-for-students.com/One-Word-Anagrams.html[line break]http://www.enchantedlearning.com/english/anagram/ was quite nice for common anagrams by subject.[line break]http://www2.vo.lu/homepages/phahn/anagrams/oneword.htm[line break]http://www.ssynth.co.uk/~gay/anagram.html[line break]http://www.wellho.net/resources/ex.php4?item=p669/anagram (basic succinct PERL anagram finder)[line break]http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-291149.html for specific words and also ideas how to script more complex stuff[line break]http://www.rinkworks.com/words/oddities.shtml[line break]http://www.sporcle.com/ had many puzzles that helped me determine what was fair and what wasn't[line break]http://jamesgart.com/anagram/[line break]PERL for letting me parse through word-to-word anagrams and also helping me break one promising word into two.[paragraph break]I'd be interested if someone from France can ref these sites to make a similar game, someone from Spain could take pains, or a German manager could do so too. It'd be interesting to see.";
	say "And it's already mentioned in the credits, but [ghsite] is where the project is hosted. I recommend using source control if at all possible. Even if you just use it to keep a backup, or be sure of what you changed, it can save a lot of trouble.";
	the rule succeeds; [forgot where I found the names from]
