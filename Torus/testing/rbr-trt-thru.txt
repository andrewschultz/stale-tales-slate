Out of nowhere, a SYS-EYE pops up and whirrs around. You're not sure where it's gone. It's a bit worried you're being surveilled like that. But maybe the SYS-EYE can help you in its own weird way.

All manner of whirring seems to flow around you. The cylinder in the center of the torus lights up further. The door inside ... wherever ... flips open and closed. The path to the center looks much more solid. You take a tentative step inward on it, and this time, you're not bounced.

Yes, you decide it's time to start going ON.
seems as good a place to start as any others. The ground beneath you
seems to brighten up as you make your decision. You feel confident that if you don't do things right, you'll have another try.
[NOTE: since the map of Tours Roust Torus is circular, you can use the verbs 0 and 1 to track the rooms as numbers to make things a bit easier, here.]

The path to the cylinder is solid. The door blows open as you get there. You walk in and tumble down a slope. Around you, voices boom "RESTRAIN! RESTRAIN!" They are closing in! This is the end! But then they scatter. You pass out.
When you wake up and take stock, things are different. You feel you've seen this place before, even though you haven't. You still can't get the voices saying "RESTRAIN!" out of your head. Who were they? Why did they leave? Wait ... wait. It makes sense now. You know where this is.

You know what to do here. You may not be as sharp as you were younger, but you see the pattern. You may not see how to go through with it right away, but you see it.

It's too late for that now, but you should be able to push through as needed.

That's all. You've found a new home, one where you don't have to do anything, but you'd like to. That stuff that wasn't DEEDED, well, you can take care of it later.

#should be ttc-table-of-progress-8 but the script can't handle that yet as it goes to max
You made a good start at changing things right here, right now, but there's no rush

@max
#ttc-table-of-progress-8
That's all. You've found a new home, one where you don't have to do anything, but you'd like to. You felt back to your old adventuring self, being able to anagram everything in sight that could be, no matter how obscure, eager for more. And yet the lessons you applied ruling Yorpwald will work here in the Strainer Terrains, too. You wonder if you should give your successors a call, to see if the Torus would benefit from being a part of something bigger. You can make that decision later.
