Tours Roust Torus is about light-hearted jokes, and there's nothing light-hearted about that. So, yeah, don't try it again.

Tours Roust Torus doesn't have a deep bench of standard verbs, though in each room, you need to find something special to do or say or think. For a general list of verbs, type VERBS.
#PREP AREA is now nothing, so we get the standard response, but it's worth testing

A voice booms "Noon? No! No!" It's quite direct, and it makes you lose yourself in mazy thinking. But there must be a simple, effective way to push back!

Yes, you decide it's time to start going ON. Tattletale seems as good a place to start as any others. The ground beneath you in Tattletale seems to brighten up as you make your decision. You feel confident that if you don't do things right, you'll have another try.
>on
You're already in the process of going on.
>a
Odd. You can't move that slowly. Moving one section over isn't really moving ON, I guess. So going A or B is out.

All manner of whirring seems to flow around you. The cylinder in the center of the torus lights up further. The door inside ... wherever ... flips open and closed. The path to the center looks much more solid. You take a tentative step inward on it, and this time, you're not bounced.

[NOTE: since the map of Tours Roust Torus is circular, you can use the verbs 0 and 1 to track the rooms as numbers to make things a bit easier, here.]
