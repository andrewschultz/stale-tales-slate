#ttc-table-of-one-time-warnings-sys-eye
>yes
Out of nowhere, a SYS-EYE pops up and whirrs around. You're not sure where it's gone. It's a bit worried you're being surveilled like that. But maybe the SYS-EYE can help you in its own weird way.

>yes
The SYS-EYE does not reveal itself. Perhaps it is just there as bizarre help, in its own way.

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-sys
>ssy
You doubt you can do something with the sys-eye beyond thinking yes. But maybe this is a clue what to do elsewhere

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-eye
>yee

You doubt you can do something with the sys-eye beyond thinking yes. But maybe this is a clue what to do elsewhere

#ttc-table-of-pre-brushoffs-ehs-ehs-(eh|ehs)

No, you can't lackadaisically go along with what's there. You need to invent, or reinvent, something new, some different way of emoting.

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tas

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tastats

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tasttat

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tat

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tsetse

#mistake test for rapparee
>rapparee
You don't need to consort with thieves.
!Besides

#mistake test for reap
>reap
Perhaps there is something to reap once you figure what to do here. In a weird way, you feel you're halfway there, though.

#mistake test for perp
>perp
That doesn't take care of the whole area.

#mistake test for pear
>pear
You already got fruits for Curtis in Rustic Citrus long ago. In a weird way, you feel you're halfway there, though.

#mistake test for rape
>rape
Tours Roust Torus is about light-hearted jokes, and there's nothing light-hearted about that. So, yeah, don't try it again.

#mistake test for earp
>earp
No daredevil gunman appears to help you out.
!Besides

#mistake test for reap pear

You are very, very, very close indeed. Everything is in the right order.

#mistake retest for perp
>perp
Tours Roust Torus doesn't have a deep bench of standard verbs, though in each room, you need to find something special to do or say or think. For a general list of verbs, type VERBS.
#PREP AREA is now nothing, so we get the standard response, but it's worth testing

There's nothing strictly to tame here. If there were, maybe you could use some help.
!Besides

>team
You sort of need a pal, and you sort of need a bit more.
!Besides

#ttc-table-of-pre-brushoffs-meta-meat-(meta|meat)
>meta strat
The meat -- well, it's hard to describe, but it's thankfully not physical meat. Because it's been here a while. But it's meaty enough to be something important, or to become something important. What?
>meat up
The meat -- well, it's hard to describe, but it's thankfully not physical meat. Because it's been here a while. But it's meaty enough to be something important, or to become something important. What?

>stein
You have nothing to drink, so you do not need a drink container.
!Besides

#mistake test for nites
>nites
You're too old for the nightlife. Or bad spelling.
!Besides

#mistake test for tiens
>tiens
You mentally show off your anagramming skills in languages other than English. Perhaps it's not the brain that needs attention here, though.
!Besides

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tine
>tien
You're missing an (s) to make things plural, here.

#ttc-table-of-pre-brushoffs-tines-inset-(tines|inset)
>spin tines
The tines aren't budging. Not in their present form. But what could they become?
>inset insults
The tines aren't budging. Not in their present form. But what could they become?

!Besides

#ttc-table-of-pre-brushoffs-latte-latte-latte
>latte et al
Oh, man. You don't want to even think about caffeinated beverages. Even ones with milk in. These days you don't even go in for caffeinated pop. Perhaps the latte can become something less consumable?

>tattletale
by one point
Tattletale

A voice booms "Noon? No! No!" It's quite direct, and it makes you lose yourself in mazy thinking. But there must be a simple, effective way to push back!

#ttc-table-of-post-brushoffs-latte-latte-(tattle|tale)
>tattle it
You probably don't want to encourage a tattletale in any way.
#

#mistake retest for let at
>let at
You don't need permission to be let at anything.
Besides

#ttc-table-of-one-time-warnings-door
>x door
NOTE: the door is just part of the torus. There's nothing special about it. You'll just walk through it when the time comes. Anything you try to do with the door goes to the torus.

#ttc-table-of-one-time-warnings-non
>non
NOTE: you have the right idea, simplifying "Noon," but no need for a foreign language.

>on

Yes, you decide it's time to start going ON.
seems as good a place to start as any others. The ground beneath you
seems to brighten up as you make your decision. You feel confident that if you don't do things right, you'll have another try.
[NOTE: since the map of Tours Roust Torus is circular, you can use the verbs 0 and 1 to track the rooms as numbers to make things a bit easier, here.]

Tattletale

>aaa
>aa
>aaa
>aaa
>aa
>aaa
All manner of whirring seems to flow around you. The cylinder in the center of the torus lights up further. The door inside ... wherever ... flips open and closed. The path to the center looks much more solid. You take a tentative step inward on it, and this time, you're not bounced.

>in
Scene Scene

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-cene
>ceen
You're missing an (s) to make things plural, here.

#ttc-table-of-pre-brushoffs-scene-scene-scene
>make a scene
You know what to do here. You may not be as sharp as you were younger, but you see the pattern. You may not see how to go through with it right away, but you see it.

#mistake test for senescense
>senescense
Almost, but I'm going to play spelling cop, here.

#mistake test for trainer
>trainer
You're on your own here. If almost three games aren't enough to whip you in shape, I don't know what is.

#mistake test for retrain/retrains
>retrain
It's too late for that now, but you should be able to push through as needed.
>retrains
It's too late for that now, but you should be able to push through as needed.

You're not sure what to do, but there's a lot to do!
