This area of the torus sways slightly. You have to be in the ballpark, here. But you haven't done everything right, yet.

>ehseh
You sense a small, weird instability. You feel as though you're slightly out of proportion, even if you're very much on the right track. Perhaps you need to check your thoughts and the area name.

#testcase-mistake-tours-roust-torus-a0-0a-b0-0b
>a0
You look around the torus, deciding where to go next, but you can't quite make a move.

>0a
You look around the torus, deciding where to go next, but you can't quite make a move.

>b0
You look around the torus, deciding where to go next, but you can't quite make a move.

#ttc-table-of-one-time-warnings-sys-eye
>yes
Out of nowhere, a SYS-EYE pops up and whirrs around. You're not sure where it's gone. It's a bit worried you're being surveilled like that. But maybe the SYS-EYE can help you in its own weird way.

#ttc-table-of-rough-hashes-yes
>eyes
You can't really manipulate the SYS-EYE.

>yes
The SYS-EYE does not reveal itself. Perhaps it is just there as bizarre help, in its own way.

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-sys
>ssy
You doubt you can do something with the sys-eye beyond thinking yes. But maybe this is a clue what to do elsewhere

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-eye
>yee

You doubt you can do something with the sys-eye beyond thinking yes. But maybe this is a clue what to do elsewhere

#ttc-table-of-pre-brushoffs-ehs-ehs-(eh|ehs)
>eh
No, you can't lackadaisically go along with what's there. You need to invent, or reinvent, something new, some different way of emoting.

#ttc-table-of-one-time-warnings-voice
>x voice
NOTE: if there's a voice in the room description, you just need to LISTEN.

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tours

You don't need to act on the whole torus, here.

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-rout
>rotu
You don't need to act on the whole torus, here.

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tas
>sta
There's no tricky command to manipulate the tats further. So you can just use STAT and TATS.
#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tast
>ttsa
There's no tricky command to manipulate the tats further. So you can just use STAT and TATS.

#ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-tastats

You need all the tats to help you, and you don't need to shift them. So you can just use STAT and TATS.

You need all the tats to help you, and you don't need to shift them. So you can just use STAT and TATS.

# done above but we need to prep the hay nudges
>smell
You smell hay, and you can't help theatrically exclaiming "Ahh! Yay! Hay!" as you recall trading the straw for hay way back when.

#testcase-mistake-tours-roust-torus-hah-yah-ayy
>hah
You were glad to have the smell of hay as a clue, but let's not overdo it!

>yah
You were glad to have the smell of hay as a clue, but let's not overdo it!

>ayy
You were glad to have the smell of hay as a clue, but let's not overdo it!

#ttc-table-of-rough-hashes-hay
>hyah
You can't really do anything with the hay.

#+ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-hya
>ayh
While lots of snappy noises come to mind, you can't do anything with the smell of hay. It was there, and it gave you a boost you'll cash in on, you're sure.

#+ttc-table-of-nudge-hashes-yahyah
>hyhyaa
No, you can't do anything with the smell of hay. It was there, and it gave you a boost you'll cash in on, you're sure.

You don't need to consort with thieves.

#testcase-mistake-tours-roust-torus-perp

That doesn't take care of the whole area.

#testcase-mistake-tours-roust-torus-pear

You already got fruits for Curtis in Rustic Citrus long ago. In a weird way, you feel you're halfway there, though.

#testcase-mistake-tours-roust-torus-rape
>rape
Tours Roust Torus is about light-hearted jokes, and there's nothing light-hearted about that. So, yeah, don't try it again.

#testcase-mistake-tours-roust-torus-earp
>earp
No daredevil gunman appears to help you out.
!Besides

#testcase-mistake-tours-roust-torus-reap-pear

You think you've got it, but for some reason you feel a little ... spacy.
Besides, you already did this for Curtis after you defeated Elvira in A Roiling Original.

>aaeerrpp
This area of the torus sways slightly. You have to be in the ballpark, here. But you haven't done everything right, yet.

>aaeerrrp
You sense a small, weird instability. You feel as though you're slightly out of proportion, even if you're very much on the right track. Perhaps you need to check your thoughts and the area name.

Tours Roust Torus doesn't have a deep bench of standard verbs, though in each area of the torus, you need to find one specific word (no spaces) to do or say or think. For a general list of verbs, type VERBS.
#PREP AREA is now nothing, so we get the standard response, but it's worth testing

The meat -- well, it's hard to describe, but it's thankfully not physical meat. Because it's been here a while. But it's meaty enough to be something important, or to become something important. What?

seems as good a place to start as any others. The ground beneath you

seems to brighten up as you make your decision. You feel confident that if you don't do things right, you'll have another try.
[NOTE: since the map of Tours Roust Torus is circular, you can use the verbs 0 and 1 to track the rooms as numbers to make things a bit easier, here.]

A voice whispers DEEDED ... DEEDED ... you're torn between just figuring what to do here and moving on, because "deeded" would probably involve signing a lot of boring contracts, or just figuring how to settle in quickly.

You don't need to provide any variant on DEEDED. Just saying it will get you extra puzzles.

>deeded
You're not sure what to do, but there's a lot to do!
!You already took on an additional challenge.

[NOTE: these final optional puzzles are meant to be difficult, and the words are a bit obscure. If you prefer a more moderate challenge, now's a good time to use the TATS.]
