The cylinder in the center of the torus contracts. No, it stops wobbling so much, so it only seems narrower. But that's good, too.

The cylinder continues to straighten up. It's barely wobbling now.

The cylinder -- well, it's almost still, but you can't make anything out there, yet.

The cylinder stops wavering. You're pretty sure you can see a door in it.

The cylinder clears up some more. Yes, that's definitely a door. And you can see a handle on it. You think!.

Well now! A rainbow-like path appears to lead you to the center cylinder from here, as well as everywhere else you visited. But you don't trust it yet. You sense there's just a bit more to do here.

A voice booms "Noon? No! No!" It's quite direct, and it makes you lose yourself in mazy thinking. But there must be a simple, effective way to push back!

#ttc-table-of-progress-7
The path to the center of the torus grows firmer. You try to rush inward, but something invisible bounces you back. Perhaps there's one more thing to do. Strange. You seem to have figured out every area of the torus.

>on

Yes, you decide it's time to start going ON.
seems as good a place to start as any others. The ground beneath you
seems to brighten up as you make your decision. You feel confident that if you don't do things right, you'll have another try.
[NOTE: since the map of Tours Roust Torus is circular, you can use the verbs 0 and 1 to track the rooms as numbers to make things a bit easier, here.]

All manner of whirring seems to flow around you. The cylinder in the center of the torus lights up further. The door inside ... wherever ... flips open and closed. The path to the center looks much more solid. You take a tentative step inward on it, and this time, you're not bounced.

That's all. You've found a new home, one where you don't have to do anything, but you'd like to. You felt back to your old adventuring self, being able to anagram everything in sight that could be, no matter how obscure, eager for more. And yet the lessons you applied ruling Yorpwald will work here in the Strainer Terrains, too. You wonder if you should give your successors a call, to see if the Torus would benefit from being a part of something bigger. You can make that decision later.
