A voice booms "Noon? No! No!"
It's quite direct, and it makes you lose yourself in mazy thinking. But there must be a simple, effective way to push back!

>on

Yes, you decide it's time to start going ON.

# "in tattletale" and "in reappear" are checked below, but here we want to make sure things pass in general
seems to brighten up as you make your decision. You feel confident that if you don't do things right, you'll have another try.
[NOTE: since the map of Tours Roust Torus is circular, you can use the verbs 0 and 1 to track the rooms as numbers to make things a bit easier, here.]

>deeded
Regardless of what DEEDED may or may not mean, you think the word. You say the word. New things and people pop up. You're not sure what to wrestle with first! And, of course, the general area (Scene Scene) still offers something.
!You already took on an additional challenge.

#tats uses a testing-cheat command which warps things, so noting the final optional puzzle is counterintuitive. It's getting tested more than enough elsewhere.
