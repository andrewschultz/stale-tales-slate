You reckon this had to be the easiest area to figure. Everything else will probably be tougher. But sometimes a mild interjection can steel you for what's ahead.

Your immediate reaction is to feel a bit silly figuring this area just now, after you already got a few harder ones. But then you feel smart that you weren't scared of the potentially tougher errors. What else can you say to that but "Sheesh?"

You meet (hah) up with a teammate! It's good to have one on this forbidding torus. After some talk, they admit they're out of ideas. But maybe when you come back at the right time, you'll have something to think up. You can only hope.
!Now that you have a teammate and a reason to reappear

>reappear
Now that you have a teammate and a reason to reappear, you have a plan to brainstorm separately and then together. You figure a lot of things that make the Torus a lot more alive. It glows significantly.
!You get some practice in reappearing. Maybe soon you will have someone to reappear for.

You have unleashed a tattletale who knows horrible stories of horrible people. And yet, there's no way to bring said horrible people to account.

The Torus seems more alive now that the intestines are not just near the pechan/stomach but, by some, err, happenchance, they seem to connect and perform some vital organ function.
!Okay, so there are intestines next to a stomach. You probably need a bit of luck to get things working. But you've made a good start.
!You've made your own luck in this stomach-y room. But a stomach by itself can't do much.

A voice booms "Noon? No! No!"
It's quite direct, and it makes you lose yourself in mazy thinking. But there must be a simple, effective way to push back!

>on
Yes, you decide it's time to start going ON. Tattletale seems as good a place to start as any others. The ground beneath you in Tattletale seems to brighten up as you make your decision. You feel confident that if you don't do things right, you'll have another try.
>on
You're already in the process of going on.
>a
You feel too full of nervous energy now that you are ON. You feel completely unable to move over one section of the torus at a time. So going one square over with A or B is out.

The interior of the Torus shudders, but nothing conclusive happens. The voice in the background mumbling "Buh ... buh ... buh ..." dies out. Perhaps it is somehow bored with you running the same distance each time. But there seems to be nothing to stop you from going ON and trying again.

The "Uhh, hubbub!" continues, relatively lively. Or is it "Huh, hubbub?"
The voice changes from "Uhh hubbub" to a crescendo. "Hub! HUB! HUB!!!!!"
Then it cuts off. You A disorienting light flashes through the center of the torus, leaving the door flapping open and closed. The path to the center looks much more solid. You take a tentative step inward on it, and this time, you're not bounced.
There doesn't seem to be anything else to do. Now's probably a good time to go INSIDE.

#Here we reset to go back to the main path now that we've verified the alternate/counterclockwise branch works.

You're not sure what to do, but there's a lot to do!
!You already took on an additional challenge.

[NOTE: these final optional puzzles are meant to be difficult, and the words are a bit obscure. If you prefer a more moderate challenge, now's a good time to use the TATS.]
