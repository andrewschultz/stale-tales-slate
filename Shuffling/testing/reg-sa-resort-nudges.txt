You can just use either the cork or the wings to leave to the east

>wings
>eter
The tree sits there.

A shed may provide shade, but you need a way up.

Perhaps it's best to keep it simple and cut down the riot.

>trio

They're just a simple protest.

>pottre
Picking one person out of a crowd never works."

>ether
The trio remains unmoved. Perhaps you can give the protest more constructive aims?

>potters

>ether
The trio remains unmoved. Perhaps you can get the potters something to work with?

>chainlinks
You're overthinking it. Or you hope you are. It's both a chain, and links.

>ainch
Hm, maybe you can do something with the chain. Or the links.

>china

>ainch
The china's gone--see what you can do with the links.

>bull
Burdell's laugh echoes. 'You think you can change ME?!'
>burdell
Burdell's laugh echoes. 'You think you can change ME?!'

The boot is already a little--modified. You can see its toe. Maybe that is a weakness.

>scar
Now's not the time for cosmetic stuff!
>crass
Now's not the time for cosmetic stuff!

Red Bull Burdell laughs at your puny attempt. There's no weakness in the cutlery--maybe somewhere, or something, else?
>tshirt
You slur out a few consonants--maybe you should work with something closer, lower down.

>e
Roman Manor

>roman
You like your manor just fine now. No need to change it. It's just all the EXITS you don't want to worry about.
>exits
That's not quite the right sort of nothing.

[ennui].
