>resotr
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.

>tilse
The tiles seem to shift a bit, but not enough.
>tiel
You need to deal with all the tiles.

>islet

>sadn
The sand is just--well, sand. It won't help you get off the island.
>thesadn
The sand is just--well, sand. It won't help you get off the island.

>tilse
Nothing happens. You may need to deal with something specific on the islet to leave.

>eter
The tree sits there, but the swing rocks a bit.

>aftol
You notice writing on the rock and swing similar to what you just said. Or tried to say. Also, no need to make anything lo-fat here.

>crko
Hmm, a rock, but only so much you can do with it.
>cork
>crko
Your head swims then sinks as you realize the cork can't become much else.

>aftol
You have a way off this island to the east, though you can make the other for fun, too. Also, no need to make anything lo-fat here.

>winsg
The swing goes slightly airborne.
>wings
>winsg
The wings should be able to propel you enough.

>aftol
You can just use either the cork or the wings to leave to the east.

>eter
The tree sits there.

>e
An Odd Low Woodland

>woodladn
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.

>loto
Hm, no, the whole tool shed.
>shde
Hm, no, the whole tool shed.
>asdeh
A shed may provide shade, but you need a way up.


>windwo
They remain still. Maybe the toolshed itself.
>windwos
They remain still. Maybe the toolshed itself.

>ulokc
Nope. That lock's secure.
>lokc
Nope. That lock's secure.

>pelo
Only changing one pole would still leave a vertical barrier.
>polse
The poles start to bend at an angle--or maybe that's the light.
>slope
>pelso
You wouldn't want to make the slope crumble away.

>respo
>ropes
>repo
Those are already useful.
>respo
The ropes are useful for climbing, which you need to do to get east.

>grisp
The sprig seems to grow less fragile for a moment.
>grips
>pirg
Those are already useful.
>pgris
You can't get ahold of anything that would be more useful than the grips.

>e

Hotspot
>hotspto
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.

>riotesr
They're just a riot. You may lump them together for your purposes. It'll be for society's good.

>peopel
Perhaps it's best to keep it simple and cut down the riot.
>hored
Perhaps it's best to keep it simple and cut down the riot.
>uprisesr
Perhaps it's best to keep it simple and cut down the riot.

>i rot
Don't give up! Perhaps there are only four or fewer rioters with their heart really in it.

>troi
The riot's still a crowd. A BIG crowd.
>trio
>troi
You can deal with three people. But you'll have to change their motivations.

>ersprotest
They're just a simple protest.

>ether
They're not bad people

>ethre
The trio remains unmoved. Perhaps you can give the protest more constructive aims?

>potters

>pottre
Picking one person out of a crowd never works.

>pottesr
You cut the riot down, but you need to change their protest now.

>ethre
The trio remains unmoved. Perhaps you can get the potters something to work with?

>chainliskn
You're overthinking it. Or you hope you are. It's both a chain, and links.

>ainch
The links rattle slightly. Perhaps they are chaining others' creativity as well as your own, as they are now.

>china

>kilns

>getotu
Red Bull Burdell snickers, but a bit uneasily, at--whatever you just said.

>get out

>rde
Burdell's laugh echoes. "You think you can change ME?!"
>bllu
Burdell's laugh echoes. "You think you can change ME?!"
>burdlle
Burdell's laugh echoes. "You think you can change ME?!"
>boto
The boot is already a little--modified. You can see its toe. Maybe that is a weakness.
>teo
But what to do with Red Bull Burdell's toe now that he's yelling GET OUT?
>scar
Now's not the time for cosmetic stuff!
>crssa
Now's not the time for cosmetic stuff!
>cutleyr
Red Bull Burdell laughs at your puny attempt. There's no weakness in the cutlery--maybe somewhere, or something, else?
>tshirt
You slur out a few consonants--maybe you should work with something closer, lower down.

>tug toe

>e
Roman Manor

>romna
You like your manor just fine now. No need to change it. It's just all the EXITS you don't want to worry about.
>extis
That's not quite the right sort of nothing.
>marbel
You don't even want to TRY any more anagrams. You just want to BE...and not even take any of the exits here.
>spier
You don't even want to TRY any more anagrams. You just want to BE...and not even take any of the exits here.
>toastre
You don't even want to TRY any more anagrams. You just want to BE...and not even take any of the exits here.
