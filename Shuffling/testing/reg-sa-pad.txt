You can toggle spaces between the letters with SPACE(S), or you can set them directly with SPACE(S) ON/NO SPACE(S), or SON/NOS for short.

You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. You notice weird hazes around Store R, store M, Store I, Store F and Store B when you do.
 [You decide to keep a to-do entry in your notebook of stuff you haven't tackled, yet.]

[You record the information about to-do in your notepad.]

You stare into the blue lube for a bit. You see a small story unfold.

You see yourself walking into woods instead of store F. Well, not quite woods. You think you hear lumber rumble.

After this vision, you shake your head a bit on seeing yourself taking six foot-high letters labeled ANGLE and crumpling them into AN. Then you do the same for GLEAN, which folds to GL. (Fourth wall time, to be clear--you can use four abbreviations, now.)

>pad macros
ANGLE=AN to see changeable items, GLEAN=GL to see the story ahead.

[Note: the above was random dialogue that can be turned off with HUSH or on with UHHS. If you forget this, it's in your notepad. Also, if you want all the dialogue, no need to hit Z a ton. You can read the source or, to see it formatted a bit better, solve the game.]

>pad hush
UHHS turns on random dialogue, HUSH turns it off.
>pad uhhs
UHHS turns on random dialogue, HUSH turns it off.
