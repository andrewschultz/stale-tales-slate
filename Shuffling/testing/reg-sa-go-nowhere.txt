#nowhere thickest thickets

WRONG REDO
You hit a snag, and the toga nags you. Or seems to.
You suppress an insult that would maybe only make sense if the darnels were sentient.
Plus, if you could go anywhere, you might regret winding up in the Tuffest Tuffets.
>n
You see a snipe among some pines and lose your spine
>n
You're feeling negative to vegetation, so you can't see a way through.
>n
A stick crawling with ticks gives you pause
>n
I won't let snag-tangles get at you that way.

You hear tectonic noises, then an evil voice whispering 'Once it's...' You sense running away wouldn't work. Through the gateway it is, though it'd be nice to have some help.

>gonear trips strip
#nowhere trips strip
>n
As you try to flee the Trips Strip, a voice boomes "Run off for fun? Urff, no!"
Up pops a bush--a hubs bush! It's too thick to walk through. You move to the side, but the bush expands. Defeated, you turn back to the center--and when you look around, you notice the hubs bush encircles the whole Trips Strip. Guess you'll need to explore the stores.
>n
The hubs bush forces you back to the center of the Trips Strip. You're stuck here with the stores, unless you can change or enter one.

No going back. Storing's west, sorting's east, and Corses Crosse is north.

#nowhere flesh shelf

It's too steep down every way except back east.

You don't need an alert sign to know running into the walls any direction but west would cause a real sting.

#nowhere cruel ones' enclosure

You think you hear 'Lo! Censure lures once!' There seems to be nothing, or worse than nothing, that way. You can go back south or try to go north.

Without any sort of guide to look at you'd be (ugh) SOL--or it'd be a pointless, uh, slog.

Mum, dud mud blocks your way. You can only go north to the kitchen or east.

The rime-mire all round is too dangerous, but nothing's stopping you from leaving (opposite) the way you came.

There is no other way except back west. Anyway, you might find scared cadres you aren't equipped to deal with, or scarce dreads.

There's condos north, a library west, a flower shop east, and a seedier area south. But there are no special exits.

You suddenly have ye taxin' any-exit anxiety. Like you're in the middle of an exitstential crisis.
I best sit, be, you think.
Sit, ex-adventurer.
Where would you go? Texis, perhaps
Seeing exits just makes you want to...
Aww, c'mon, this one's just switching TWO WHOLE LETTERS. You had other tougher ones to MAKE it here! There are alternate solutions based on Means Manse, but ... maybe you're overthinking.
