>gonear rested desert

The size of the desert, um, deters you. You're steer'd back to the odor.

>blot
>w
The size of the desert, um, deters you. You're steer'd back to the door. The one you can probably go through.

>gonear thickest thickets
#nowhere thickest thickets
>w
You hit a snag, and the toga nags you. Or seems to. Plus, if you could go anywhere, you might regret winding up in the Tuffest Tuffets.
!you can go IN--there are no specific directions here

>slander
!You suppress an insult

>gonear notices section
#nowhere notices section
>w
You hear tectonic noises, then an evil voice whispering "Once it's..." You sense running away wouldn't work. Through the gateway it is, though it'd be nice to have some help.
>gateman
>w
You hear tectonic noises, then an evil voice whispering "Once it's..." You sense running away wouldn't work. Through the gateway it is!

>gonear trips strip
#nowhere trips strip
>w
As you try to flee the Trips Strip, a voice booms "Run off for fun? Urff, no!"
Up pops a bush--a hubs bush! It's too thick to walk through. You move to the side, but the bush expands.
Defeated, you turn back to the center--and when you look around, you notice the hubs bush encircles the whole Trips Strip. Guess you'll need to explore the stores, or what you can make of them.
>w
The hubs bush forces you back to the center of the Trips Strip. Guess you'll need to explore the stores, or what you can make of them.
>forest
>w

>gonear self id fields
#nowhere self id fields
>s
Given that the people leaving the selves vessel look dead, you probably don't want to go in.

>gonear flesh shelf
#nowhere flesh shelf
>w
It's too steep down every way except back east.

>gonear gnarliest triangles
#nowhere gnarliest triangles
>e
You don't need an alert sign to know running into the walls any direction but west would cause a real sting.

>gonear emptiness sepiments
#nowhere emptiness sepiments
>w
The scoffer coffers and scoffin' coffins are impenetrable. But even if they weren't, there are probably slayer layers, or worse, behind.

>gonear ghouls slough
#nowhere ghouls slough
>w
Without any sort of guide to look at you'd be (ugh) SOL--or it'd be a pointless, uh, slog.
!Hey,
>purloin maps
>w
Without any sort of guide to look at you'd be (ugh) SOL--or it'd be a pointless, uh, slog. Hey, those maps might be useful to look at, though.

>gonear frost forts
#nowhere frost forts
>w
The gnash hangs would, err, shnag you.
>wolves
>w
The werewolves will catch you easily.

>gonear the nick
#nowhere the nick

You're trapped. If only the nick could be changed to something more to your taste.

>gonear trap part
#nowhere trap part

>gonear moor
#nowhere moor
>w
The rime-mire all round is too dangerous, but nothing's stopping you from leaving (opposite) the way you came.

>gonear sacred cedars
#nowhere sacred cedars
>e
There is no other way except back west. Anyway, you might find scared cadres you aren't equipped to deal with, or scarce dreads.

>gonear roarings garrison
#nowhere roarings garrison
>in
There's a residence north, a library west, a flower shop east, and a seedier area south. But there are no special exits.

>gonear bile libe
#nowhere bile libe
>w
Only way out's back east.

>gonear fo real florae
#nowhere fo real florae
>e
You wouldn't want to disturb them while they're measuring geraniums or anything back there.
>e
"Back rooms? Smack boor!" you imagine the faeries saying.
>e
That's where all the magic happens
>n
The only safe way out is back west.

>gonear the ol hotel
#nowhere the ol hotel
>w
You don't want to find that L'Hôte Helot is The Hell, Too. Better to find a way to fix it, or the city.

>gonear esoteric coteries
#nowhere esoteric coteries
>e
The Earliest Ateliers are not for you to visit. You're more an adventurer than a researcher.

>gonear elm train terminal
#nowhere elm train terminal
>w
The cafe face is in the way. Maybe you could climb it.
>s
The tracks lead down east, and the city is back north.

>gonear bassy abyss
#nowhere bassy abyss
>w
You try to flee, but there's no way back to Elm Train Terminal. You feel a sharp headache. It's an aligns signal, and it must be encompassing the whole abyss. It turns you back to face the beats.
>w
You try to flee, but there's no way back to Elm Train Terminal. You feel a sharp headache. It's that aligns signal, again. It turns you back to face the beats.

>gonear astral altars
#nowhere astral altars
>w
As you step away from the altars, a weird barrier blocks you. It's very tarsal. Then a voice in your head booms "ONE LIKE YOU IS BEYOND THE FERAL FLARE!"
>w
No, the feral flare is pretty much any which way. Looks like you'll need to do something with the tiles and stile, instead.

>gonear leis isle
#nowhere leis isle
>w
You step into the woodland and somehow bang your head! You see the word DOWNLOAD blinking in front of you. Odd, very odd.

>gonear potshot hotspot
#nowhere potshot hotspot
>w
No going back now.
>e
That rabble seems mad at you. You'd better disperse them first.
>trio
>e
They still outnumber you. Though they're only blocking you out of spite. They just--well, they don't have anything to do, and they're sort of expecting you to give them something better to do than, well, protest.
>potters
>e
They seem a civil trio, buy as you inch east, they get vitriolic. "Give us something to do!"
>kilns
>e
Not with Red Bull Burdell around, you aren't. That "get out" is just standard villainous taunting a clever hero can take advantage of.
>tug toe
>n
The only way you'll want to go is east.

>gonear rived drive
#nowhere rived drive
>w
You'd probably get lost that way. Besides, the vague commotion to the east, past the rising poles, seems worth seeing.
>slope
>w
You'd probably get lost that way. Besides, the vague commotion to the east, past the rising slope, seems worth seeing.

>gonear means manse
#nowhere means manse
>w
You suddenly have ye taxin' any-exit anxiety. Like you're in the middle of an exitstential crisis.
