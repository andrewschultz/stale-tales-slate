#nowhere rested desert

The size of the desert, um, deters you. You're steer'd back to the odor.

#nowhere thickest thickets
>n
WRONG REDO
You hit a snag, and the toga nags you. Or seems to.
You suppress an insult that would maybe only make sense if the darnels were sentient.
Plus, if you could go anywhere, you might regret winding up in the Tuffest Tuffets.
>n
You see a snipe among some pines and lose your spine
>n
You're feeling negative to vegetation, so you can't see a way through.
>n
A stick crawling with ticks gives you pause
>n
I won't let snag-tangles get at you that way.
>goat
>n
(you can go IN--there are no specific directions here)

#nowhere notices section
>n
You hear tectonic noises, then an evil voice whispering 'Once it's...' You sense running away wouldn't work. Through the gateway it is, though it'd be nice to have some help.

#nowhere trips strip
>n
As you try to flee the Trips Strip, a voice boomes "Run off for fun? Urff, no!"
Up pops a bush--a hubs bush! It's too thick to walk through. You move to the side, but the bush expands. Defeated, you turn back to the center--and when you look around, you notice the hubs bush encircles the whole Trips Strip. Guess you'll need to explore the stores.
>n
The hubs bush forces you back to the center of the Trips Strip. You're stuck here with the stores, unless you can change or enter one.
