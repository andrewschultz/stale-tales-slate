>gonear thickest thickets
#nowhere thickest thickets
>w
You hit a snag, and the toga nags you. Or seems to. Plus, if you could go anywhere, you might regret winding up in the Tuffest Tuffets.

>gonear notices section
#nowhere notices section
>w
You hear tectonic noises, then an evil voice whispering "Once it's..." You sense running away wouldn't work. Through the gateway it is, though it'd be nice to have some help.

>gonear trips strip
#nowhere trips strip
>w
As you try to flee the Strip of Profits, a voice boomes "Run off for fun? Urff, no!"
Up pops a bush--a hubs bush! It's too thick to walk through. You move to the side, but the bush expands.
Defeated, you turn back to the center--and when you look around, you notice the hubs bush encircles the whole Strip of Profits. Guess you'll need to explore the stores.
>w
The hubs bush forces you back to the center of the Strip of Profits. Guess you'll need to explore the stores.
>forest
>w
The hubs bush forces you back to the center of the Trips Strip. Guess you'll need to explore the stores, or what you made of them.

>gonear emptiness sepiments
#nowhere emptiness sepiments
>nw
The scoffer coffers and scoffin' coffins are impenetrable. But even if they weren't, there are probably slayer layers, or worse, behind.

>gonear ghouls slough
#nowhere ghouls slough
>w
Without any sort of guide to look at you'd be (ugh) SOL--or it'd be a pointless, uh, slog[if player has maps]. Hey, those maps might be useful to look at, though[end if].

>gonear frost forts
#nowhere frost forts
>w
The gnash hangs would, err, shnag you.
>wolves

The rime-mire all round is too dangerous, but nothing's stopping you from leaving (opposite) the way you came.

>gonear sacred cedars
#nowhere sacred cedars
>w
There is no other way except back west. Anyway, you might find scared cadres you aren't equipped to deal with, or scarce dreads.

>gonear roarings garrison
#nowhere roarings garrison
>in
There's a residence north, a library west, a flower shop east, and a seedier area south. But there are no special exits.

>gonear the ol hotel
#nowhere the ol hotel
>w
You don't want to find that L'Hôte Helot is The Hell, Too. Better to find a way to fix it, or the city.

>gonear esoteric coteries
#nowhere esoteric coteries
>w
The Earliest Ateliers are not for you to visit. You're more an adventurer than a researcher.

>gonear elm train terminal
#nowhere elm train terminal
>w
The tracks lead down east, and the city is back north.

>gonear bassy abyss
#nowhere bassy abyss
>w
You try to flee, but you feel a sharp headache. It's an aligns signal, and it must be encompassing the whole abyss. It turns you back to face the beats.

>gonear astral altars
#nowhere astral altars
>w
As you step away from the altars, a weird barrier blocks you. It's very tarsal. Then a voice in your head booms "ONE LIKE YOU IS BEYOND THE FERAL FLARE!"
>w
No, the feral flare is pretty much any which way. Looks like you'll need to do something with the tiles and stile, instead.

>gonear leis isle
#nowhere leis isle
>w
You step into the woodland and somehow bang your head! You see the word DOWNLOAD blinking in front of you. Odd, very odd.

>gonear rived drive
#nowhere rived drive
>w
You'd probably get lost that way. Besides, the vague commotion to the east, past the rising poles, seems worth seeing.
>slope

>gonear means manse
#nowhere means manse
>w
You suddenly have ye taxin['] any-exit anxiety. Like you're in the middle of an exitstential crisis.
