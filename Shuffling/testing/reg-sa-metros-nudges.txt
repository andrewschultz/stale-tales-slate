>purloin arena dig
>arena
The invite's for an ARENA DIG.
>dig
The invite's for an ARENA DIG.

>rifle
Shooting things up

The flier has helpful information it'd be better to act on than change.

It's just garbage.
>note
It's just garbage.
>beer
It's just garbage.
>flier
It's just garbage.
>letter
It's just garbage. The writing inside, too.

>purloin can of beer
>canofbeer
The beer is just garbage, not even organic like the drainage. But its name is interesting.

>purloin noise bag

>noies
Even if you could do anything, that'd rip the noise bag open.
>bga
Even if you could do anything, that'd rip the noise bag open.

>metallci
No way. That thing's sturdy. The people in there know their stuff.

>drawign
You can't change the drawing, and that won't make its warnings any less relevant.
>opticla
Changing the beam is way out of your league.
>bema
Changing the beam is way out of your league.
>escalator
No way. It's your way up from the metros. Once you fix things.

>buildign
You can't restore the hotel or even scrub off what's written on it.
>gardenia
by one point
>hotel
You can't restore the hotel.
>sensro
You don't have the skill to hack the sensor electronically.

You can't change the hotel, but you could have another look around.

#skipping the camp right now to get the tomato from the alley

>w
A Yell Alley

>placadr
It's just junk. As itself, and for your quest. But maybe what's written on it can help.

>garbaeg
Worry about repurposing garbage after you saved Yorpwald, maybe.

>ylle
[loc-rej].
>yllea
[loc-rej].

>motot
It's labeled A MOTTO. So you probably have to respect the creative license, such as it is, of whoever wrote it.

The author twisted words enough. Perhaps you could concentrate on it.

The Ol' Hotel

>helot
[loc-rej].

>thign
The night thing is twisted beyond redemption.

>potato
The night thing would probably still be big and terrifying even if it changed its form. You need to find a way to get rid of it.

>throw tomato at thing

>bupm
Just search the bump instead.

>lucer
You're a wordplayer, not a doctor, sadly. But that ulcer was the night thing's own fault, anyway.

[no-ketch].
>ketchpu
[no-ketch].
>catsup
You think of how to make the ketchup slightly classier. [no-ketch].

Nothing to change the mattress to, even if you could move the night thing off.

>mattrses
Nothing to change the mattress to, but something might be inside it.
>x mattrses
>mattress
Nothing to change the mattress to, and you already looted it

>emittre
Whatever icky stuff is/was in there might come out. Eww.

>theol
You can't change the hotel, and you got rid of the night thing, anyway.

The harps are kind of annoying, but they've got nothing on the beats.

>ltso
It's not just that it's lost, it's CORN[dead-help].
>conr
It's not just that it's corn, it's LOST too[dead-help]."

As anti-personal property as the deadbeats are, that'd still annoy them.

One antler seems to twitch a bit and pull towards you. Curious--it doesn't look completely relevant, but it'd be funny to see something happen to the antlers.

>candelabar
Interior decorating is not your strength.
>carpest
Interior decorating is not your strength.
>carpet
Interior decorating is not your strength.
>talkesr
You can't change who they are. They probably can't, either. It's sad.
>talkre
You can't change who they are. They probably can't, either. It's sad.
>caek
It isn't just any cake. It's dry cake.

It isn't just any cake. It's dry cake.

You've already changed the lost corn into the controls, and you don't need to do more.

by one point

>leavse
It's the whole clover you need to change.

>fuzyz
The fuzziness seems to be part of the clover. It might be, even if you're able to change the clover.

No need to mess with the string joining the velcro mittens.

Probably best not to do stuff to even one heath while the faeries have them
>begonai
Probably best not to do stuff to even one begonia while the faeries have them.

>fairise
They could CERTAINLY out-magic you back, and give a little extra for your misspelling, even if anagramming could have an effect on them.
>faiyr
The rest would mangle you back worse.
>faeyr
The rest would mangle you back worse.

>stesm
Deal with the whole flower, not just the stems.

>trounec
You don't need to do anything to the counter, and it's probably protected by a spell, anyway.

>faerise
They could CERTAINLY out-magic you back, and give a little extra for your misspelling, even if anagramming could have an effect on them.

>give gardenia to faieirs
>take heaths
>heaht
They are multiple heaths--so you should try to change just one.

>take brocade
>scratchinsg
They're not important--the brocade probably is, though.

The nerds look at you, then remark they can't decipher THAT. But maybe if you rearranged things a bit...
>asknerd
"You can ask us all!" one nerd blurts. "We can pool our collective knowledge in a data cloud and stuff or something!"

>ask nerds about darkness

>metallci
No way. That thing's sturdy. Those nerds know their stuff.

Elm Train Terminal
