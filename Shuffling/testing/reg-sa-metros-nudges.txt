>mersto
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
>merto
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.

You can't change the drawing, and that won't make its warnings any less relevant.
>opticla
Changing the beam is way out of your league.
>bema
Changing the beam is way out of your league.

#skipping the camp right now to get the tomato from the alley

>w
A Yell Alley

The night thing is twisted beyond redemption.

>potaot
The night thing would probably still be big and terrifying even if it changed its form. You need to find a way to get rid of it.

>lucer
You're a wordplayer, not a doctor, sadly. But that ulcer was the night thing's own fault, anyway.

>bottel
It doesn't bend, but maybe it's a clue what the night thing likes to eat.
>ketchpu
It doesn't bend, but maybe it's a clue what the night thing likes to eat.

The rest would mangle you back worse.

The rest would mangle you back worse.

>uptil
The nerds would gang up on you and take it back, if anything worked, which it won't.
>nedr
The nerds are a little obnoxious, but they've had people trying to change them all their life. You may be better off ASKing the nerds.
