#nudge for sortie
>tosrie
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.

>Ug, Frenetic Centrifuge

#nudge for centrifuge
>centrifuge
You're dizzy enough looking around without trying to focus on anything. The dial in the middle of the room seems to control it.

#nudge for frenetic
>frenetic
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room.

#nudge for sextien
>esxtien
The spinning seems to slow a bit.

#nudge for exitsnw
>xeitsnw
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.

#nudge for exitssw
>xeitssw
The room seems to spin faster, as if you are totally on the wrong track.

#nudge for exitsse
>xeitsse
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.

#nudge for exits

#nudge for dial
>dila
Messing up the dial would leave you trapped here.

#nudge for greta
>greta
The grate remains impassive.

#nudge for nick
>nikc
Maybe there is a way out of the nick. Not of nick, but the nick. It's probably too much to think yourself in K.C.

#nudge for sixteen
>ixsteen
You don't need to re-stop the centrifuge.

>kitchne
The nick blurs a little but snaps back to normal.

>kitchen
Kitchen

#####detour to check on UFR
>s
A Round Den, Unadorned

#nudge for aroundden
>aroundden
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start acting up then, anyway.

#dupnudge for dial
>dila
The dial did its part for you.

#nudge for kitchen
>ketchin
You can just walk to the kitchen, there's no need to revisit the nick, and there's no third location.

>n

#nudge for kitchne
>ketchin
Nothing happens. Well, you didn't really want to go back to the nick, and there's probably no third room to look for between the two. Maybe you need to escape this bunker from another room.

#######dumb stuff

#nudge for lamina
>lamian
It actually looks pretty nice on the fridge.

#nudge for pan
>pna
It's not a cake, and it's not quite a pan--it's a cake pan.

#nudge for cake

It's not a cake, and it's not quite a pan--it's a cake pan.

#nudge for okrapot
>okrapto
Aigh! It's a catchy tune, but really, it won't help you figure anything out.

#nudge for fridge
>frideg
The fridge is just a fridge.

#nudge for obligatory
>obligatoyr
The fridge will always be what it is. Generally what is or was inside is more interesting, anyway.

#nudge for cause
>caues
No need to do more with the hot sauce.

#nudge for packet

Fiddling with sauce packets is so awful! Until it's easy. And it should be, here. Just PUT the sauce on any food.

###############spearman
#nudge for cheesy
>cheeys
It's more that he's a spearman--but maybe his cheesiness is a clue.

#nudge for armor
>armro
The armor is impervious. Maybe you can change the guy inside it, instead.

The steak's just right as is.

You doubt the sack/cask has a triple purpose.

#nudge for burlap
>burlpa
The sack itself seems pliable, but its individual fibers aren't.

#nudge for pair

Many things can be a pair, but these hoses--well, a pair of HOSES is kind of odd.

There's more than one hose here.

>romo
You almost feel something picking you up for a second. You must have been close.
