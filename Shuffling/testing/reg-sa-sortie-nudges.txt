>tosrie
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.

>Ug, Frenetic Centrifuge

>centrifuge
You're dizzy enough looking around without trying to focus on anything. The dial in the middle of the room seems to control it.
>frenetic
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room.

>esxtien
The spinning seems to slow a bit.
>xeitsnw
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.
>xeitssw
The room seems to spin faster, as if you are totally on the wrong track.
>xeitsse
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.
>extis
You can't do much to the exits when you don't even know which way they are.
>dila
Messing up the dial would leave you trapped here.

>sixteen

>n
The Nick

>graffiit
The graffiti's etched in. It's here to help, anyway.
>greta
The grate remains impassive.
>nikc
Maybe there is a way out of the nick. Not of nick, but the nick. It's probably too much to think yourself in K.C.

>ixsteen
You don't need to re-stop the centrifuge.

>kitchne
The nick blurs a little but snaps back to normal.
>kitchen
Kitchen

#####detour to check on UFR
>s
A Round Den, Unadorned

>aroundden
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start acting up then, anyway.

>dila
The dial did its part for you.

>ketchin
You can just walk to the kitchen, there's no need to revisit the nick, and there's no third location.

>n
>ketchin
Nothing happens. Well, you didn't really want to go back to the nick, and there's probably no third room to look for between the two. Maybe you need to escape this bunker from another room.

#######dumb stuff
>x fridge

>lamian
It actually looks pretty nice on the fridge.

>pna
It's not a cake, and it's not quite a pan--it's a cake pan.
>caek
It's not a cake, and it's not quite a pan--it's a cake pan.

>okrapto
Aigh! It's a catchy tune, but really, it won't help you figure anything out.
>frideg
The fridge is just a fridge.
>obligatoyr
The fridge will always be what it is. Generally what is or was inside is more interesting, anyway.

##############ok, test tall trio and loose label that's part of them
>middel
The chefs are all lumped together--a tall trio.
>letf
The chefs are all lumped together--a tall trio.
>rigth
The chefs are all lumped together--a tall trio.
>middlechfe
The chefs are all lumped together--a tall trio.
>leftchfe

>rightchfe
The chefs are all lumped together--a tall trio.

>lable
The tall trio is probably what you want to change, but the label may have information.
>looes
The tall trio is probably what you want to change, but the label may have information.
>looselable
The tall trio is probably what you want to change, but the label may have information.

>atc
It's the full name brand that really catches your eye.
>houes
It's the full name brand that really catches your eye.

>hotsauce
by one point
>undo
>hot sauce
by one point

>caues
No need to do more with the hot sauce.
>packte
Fiddling with sauce packets is so awful! Until it's easy. And it should be, here. Just PUT the sauce on any food.

###############spearman
>cheeys
It's more that he's a spearman--but maybe his cheesiness is a clue.
>armro
The armor is impervious. Maybe you can change the guy inside it, instead.

>parmesan

##################steak
>steka
You thought you smelled meat there, for a minute. Hm.
>steak
>cutpu
The steak's just right as is.
>cutupsteka
The steak's just right as is.

######################lettuce

>lettuec
The cult tee seems to vegetate there. Change things around and it may become something.
>cutl
The whole t-shirt.
>eet
The whole t-shirt.

>put steak on tortilla
>put parmesan on tortilla

Room

>weer
The cask is changeable, but not like that. WERE-EWER just clues it can be changed.

>cska
Nothing happens. Maybe you are trying to do too much to change the cask.
>sack

>cska
You doubt the sack/cask has a triple purpose.

>burlpa
The sack itself seems pliable, but its individual fibers aren't.

>pari
Many things can be a pair, but these hoses--well, a pair of HOSES is kind of odd.

>wrat
Why zap just one wart? Go for all of them!

>straw
>put straw in sack

>heos
There's more than one hose here.

>romo
You almost feel something picking you up for a second. You must have been close.

Pat will always be woeful. He sort of likes it that way. Focus on his poetry.

The peasant's poem is about as good as it can be, for what it is. It's better than Pat's.
>poetyr
The peasant's poem is about as good as it can be, for what it is. It's better than Pat's.

>hya
Hay is not terribly magical. It's more for trading or building.

Hm, there has to be a clue in it.
>redgraffiit
Hm, there has to be a clue in it.

>roda
No, the full roadblock.
>blokc
No, the full roadblock.

You can just walk to the kitchen, there's no need to revisit the nick, and there's no third location.

>romo
The room sways a bit. You do some brief mental calculation. There's no third place between them.

There's no room between the nick and kitchen. You already found a better way out, anyway.

>e

>trellsi
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start acting up then, anyway.

The scraped wall doesn't respond or come any closer to being a hallway.
>scrapde
The scraped wall doesn't respond or come any closer to being a hallway.

>put hay in wall
>hallway

Changing Lois is highly unlikely, and you should possess the oils before doing anything with them.

>pour oils
Fluids would leak through the sack. The cask you had would be better.

>cask
>pour oils

>lio
Really, they're oils. There's so much more you can do with oils than oil. Well, two things YOU can do.

You don't want to change the missile's message, which seems rather nice.

Neither arching shakes. They're probably too sturdy, and you're probably not meant to go back.
>crashign
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start acting up then, anyway.

>rubbel
The rubble is too dense to rearrange, physically or magically. You should have as much of the oils as you need.
>trellsi
You can't seem to start to reconstruct the trellis. You only hope your work in Sacred Cedars is done.
