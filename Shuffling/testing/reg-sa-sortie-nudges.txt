>Ug, Frenetic Centrifuge

>centrifuge
[loc-rej].
>frenetic
[loc-rej].

>esxtien
The spinning seems to slow a bit.
>xeitsnw
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.
>xeitssw
The room seems to spin faster, as if you are totally on the wrong track.
>xeitsse
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.
>extis
You can't do much to the exits when you don't even know which way they are.
>dial
Messing up the dial would leave you trapped here.

>n
The Nick

>graffiti
The graffiti's etched in. It's here to help, anyway.
>greta
The grate remains impassive.
>nick
Maybe there is a way out of the nick. Not of nick, but the nick. It's probably too much to think yourself in K.C.

>ixsteen
You don't need to re-stop the centrifuge.

>kitchne
WRONG
>kitchen
Kitchen

#####detour to check on UFR
>s
A Round Den, Unadorned

>aroundden
[loc-rej].

>dial
The dial did its part for you.

>kitchen
You can just walk to the kitchen, and there's no need to revisit the nick, and there's no third location.

>n
>ketchin
Nothing happens. Well, you didn't really want to go back, and there's probably no third room to look for[if moor is unvisited]. Maybe you need to escape this bunker in another room[end if].

#######dumb stuff
>x fridge

>lamian
It actually looks pretty nice on the fridge.

>pna
[ck-p].
>caek
[ck-p].

>okrapto
Aigh! It's a catchy tune, but really, it won't help you figure anything out.
>frideg
The fridge is just a fridge.
>obligatoyr
The fridge will always be what it is. Generally what is or was inside is more interesting, anyway.

##############ok, test tall trio and loose label that's part of them

>hotsauce

>undo
>hot sauce
by one point

>caues
No need to do more with the hot sauce.
>packte
Fiddling with sauce packets is so awful! Until it's easy. And it should be, here. Just PUT the sauce on any food.

###############spearman
>cheeys
It's more that he's a spearman--but maybe his cheesiness is a clue.
>armro
The armor is impervious. Maybe you can change the guy inside it, instead.

>parmesan

##################steak
>steka
WRONG
>steak
>cutpu
The steak's just right as is.

Room

>weer
The cask is changeable, but not like that. WERE-EWER just clues it can be changed.

>cska
WRONG
>sack

>cska
WRONG

>burlpa
The sack itself seems pliable, but its individual fibers aren't.

>weer
There's no other way to change the cask than to and from the sack. I think you got the WERE-EWER clue by now.

>pari
Many things can be a pair, but these hoses--well, a pair of HOSES is kind of odd.

>wrat
No, WARTS.

>straw
>put straw in sack

>heos
Well, HOSES...

>romo
You almost feel something picking you up and pulling you somewhere else[--there are only so many ways to figure a new place.

>hya
Hay is not terribly magical. It's more for trading or building.

>graffiit
Hm, there has to be a clue in it.
>redgraffiit
Hm, there has to be a clue in it.

No, the full roadblock.

Changing Lois is highly unlikely. You have magic powers, but not godlike powers.

OILS, but

>w
Crashing Archings

>archign
Neither arching shakes. They're probably too sturdy, and you're probably not meant to go back.
>crashign
[loc-rej].

>rubbel
The rubble is too dense to rearrange, physically or magically. You should have as much of the oils as you need.
>trellsi
You can't seem to start to reconstruct the trellis. You only hope your work in Sacred Cedars is done.
