#rereadables for controls
>read controls
The opening isn't really an opening any more, what with the controls fitting in nicely.
#renudge for gin
>gni
You already transformed the neon pig to the gin-nope opening. And you put the controls in. Better not do any more.
>openign
You don't need to close up the opening. The controls are in, and they fill it well enough.
#renudge for recess
>recses
You've already made nothing out of something, and instead of reversing that, you did what you needed.

Bassy Abyss

You see yourself pounding the siren, then clapping your hands and creating a swarm of dust.

The blue glow pulses with the beats.
You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. The blue glow pulses with the beats. You notice a weird haze around the siren for a few seconds.

No going back now. You came here to defeat the beats.

No use messing with the aligns signal when you need to focus on the beats.

#mistake test for reins

Horsing around like that won't hold back the beats. You need to get a grip another way, but you're on the right track.
#mistake test for rinse

No water source. You can do better than short-circuiting the siren with water, though.
#mistake test for risen

You don't need the siren's volume or the beats' volume to have risen. Oh, no.
#??You don't need the beast's power/beats' to have risen. Oh, no.
#mistake retest for bates

You don't need to deal with a knife-wielding psycho along with the beats.

You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.

This racket isn't just one beat.
#spechelp for siren
>resni
The siren continues to blind you--like it's throwing dust in your eyes.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the siren. Keep at it.

@hin

Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see some resin.

#gadget test: siren to resin

You get to scanning, twiddling from certify to rectify and back.
Most of the screen goes blue. Then a green dot and red dot bounce left and right across the gadget screen until they stabilize: BBGBR.
The gadget beeps once. A series of lights comes across: RRRRG.
DEBUG INFO: RECT-TEXT: R---N.

You see a crooked musical chord replaced with a monster worse than the night thing. Then you take something from your sheath, and the monster collapses before you touch it.

Missed in Metros:
--the antlers in the Obtains Boastin Bastion could've become RENTALS.
Also, while the other regions are linear, the Metros has five paths based on the flowers you choose and how you get the tulip.
--the begonias could've made a noise bag.
--the other ways to get the tulip are to OPEN NOISE BAG in the Esoteric Coteries after getting the begonias or SHOW EMITTER TO DEADBEAT after using it the Bastion, then using it again in the Esoteric Coteries.
