You try to flee, but there's no way back to Elm Train Terminal. You feel a sharp headache. It's an aligns signal, and it must be encompassing the whole abyss. It turns you back to face the beats.

While the other regions are linear, the Metros has five paths based on the flowers you choose from Fo' Real Florae Fare, Lo (two ways) and how you get the tulip (three ways). One way of getting the tulip requires a specific flower.
You could have gotten the begonias from Fo' Real Florae Fare, Lo.
