>put panel in silo
The panel fits into that rectangle handily and even starts to glow. Two buttons appear on it--one says HOOTS, the other TREES. "Panel fits. Final step," you muse.

@gle

You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. The whole moor seems lit up. You notice weird hazes around the hoots button and the trees button for a few seconds.

>put door in silo
The door fits the dotted line in the silo perfectly, swinging slightly before sliding in place with a click.

>put missile in silo
You schlep the missile through the door. You hear some mechanics and whizzing. A luster-result rustle, if you will. Then "SMILIES MISSILE DEALING-ALIGNED!"

You see yourself pointing at one of the buttons before it changes. Then you push it and hear a roar.

Trees begin growing out of the side of the silo. The Trees button switches to a reset button which starts blinking violently. You push it before the trees crash down on you. They vanish, and it's a trees button again. Whew.

Resetting twice won't get you anywhere. You need a new direction to change the TREES.
