#done rejects for silo
>siol
That silo was pretty big. You probably have little more to do with the oils.

>put panel in silo
The panel fits into that rectangle handily and even starts to glow. Two buttons appear on it--one says HOOTS, the other TREES. "Panel fits. Final step," you muse.

@gle
>angle
You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. The whole moor seems lit up. You notice weird hazes around the hoots button and the trees button when you do.

>put door in silo
The door fits the dotted line in the silo perfectly, swinging slightly before sliding in place with a click.

>put missile in silo
You schlep the missile through the door. You hear some mechanics and whizzing. A luster-result rustle, if you will. Then "SMILIES MISSILE DEALING-ALIGNED!"

@gle
You see yourself pointing at one of the buttons before it changes. Then you push it and hear a roar.

#mistake test for reset/reset button
>push trees
Trees begin growing out of the side of the silo. The Trees button switches to a reset button which starts blinking violently. You push it before the trees crash down on you. They vanish, and it's a trees button again. Whew.

You don't need to reset the steer button like you did the trees button. It's what it's supposed to be.

Unfortunately, it's not QUITE as easy as just pushing a reset button, which only worked to undo the trees. But rearraning it? I hope that's not too bad.

Resetting twice won't get you anywhere. You need a new direction to change the TREES.

You get to scanning, twiddling from certify to rectify and back.
Most of the screen goes blue. Then a green dot and red dot bounce left and right across the gadget screen until they stabilize: BRBBG.
The gadget beeps once. A series of lights comes across: RRGGR.

"AMUSING GUNS! AIM!" The silo makes some ominous VVTT-KLK-BRRW noises and tilts slightly in the direction of what you assume and hope is Mean Old Mondale-Doleman's palace.
