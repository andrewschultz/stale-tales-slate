#gadget test: vowels to wolves
>rc vowels
You get to scanning, twiddling from certify to rectify and back.
Most of the screen goes blue. Then a green dot and red dot bounce left and right across the gadget screen until they stabilize: BBGBBR.
The gadget beeps once. A series of lights comes across: RGRRRG.
DEBUG INFO: Rect-text: W----S.

You won't need the blue lube to inform you that the wolves need to be dealt with. Un-magically.

You can't change them back. But maybe you can get rid of them. You do have a weapon.

They'd be much less dangerous left in a pile. Maybe you have something that can do that!
