>monty hints
You're not in the area where the magic happens, yet. The cardinal directions, including the boring lecture east, are out. There's only one way to go.
!Note: the plus sign means you can HINT again for something more spoilery. (-) means the end of a list of hints.

@nud
#nudge for ordeal
>ordela
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#nudge for oafs
>oasf
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.
#nudge for oaf
>ofa
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.
#mistake test for magnet
>magnet
Your magenta nametag is on securely enough. Not that you actually like having it on, but you'd get scolded for not having it.
>a magnet
You never need to use the article "a" when changing things up. In particular, "a magnet" is a good guess, but it's not what the nametag ultimately needs to be. Allowing a leading article might make puzzles potentially trickier, with two word jumbles to consider instead of one.
#mistake test for afos
>afos
You hum "And I Ran" to yourself, wishing you had somewhere to run, to get away.
#mistake test for faso
>faso
There are even further-away places to explore in this game than Burkina Faso.
#mistake test for salt mine/saltmine
>salt mine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?
>saltmine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?

#general stuff
#mistake test for use [text]
>use zozimus
Use is a bit too general for this game's parser to understand. You can SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.
#mistake test for turn [text]
>turn zozimus
You can probably just SWITCH something with two text settings.

@nud
#nudge for busiest
>busiets
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.
#nudge for noentry
>noentyr
You notice the NO ENTRY sign is misspelled, and you wonder what else--eh, nothing. Still, it might be fun to enter...
#nudge for slim
>slmi
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#nudge for neat
>neta
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#nudge for name

>lits
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#nudge for elevator
>elevatro
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
#nudge for terraces
>terracse
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
#nudge for terrace

A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
#nudge for caveat

Vandalizing the vacate caveat is probably more trouble than it's worth.
#nudge for banner
>bannre
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.

Rested Desert

@hin
What can the odor turn into? Your random thoughts are not so random. (+)
Note: the plus sign means you can HINT again for something more spoilery. (-) means the end of a list of hints.
>z
The clues and distractions collapse to anagrams. (+)
>z
If you get to the end, you'll notice two rather forced ones. They both anagram odor. What else do they anagram? (+)
>z
A door. (-)
A minus sign means you've reached the end of a hint loop. You can cycle through them again, though.

@nud
#nudge for rested
>restde
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. You'll find a hint device for that soon enough.
#mistake test for deters
>deters
No! You're trying to make progress here.

@nud
#nudge for breeze
>breeez
You try to think of it that way, but--nope, it's an odor. Not a very complex one, but an odor.
#nudge for smlel
>smlle
You try to think of it that way, but--nope, it's an odor. Not a very complex one, but an odor.

@nud
#spechelp for odor
>doro
The odor doesn't seem too complex. You pause. You can figure what it should be.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the odor. Keep at it.

@mis
#mistake test for or do door
>rood
This game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

>door
by one point

@hin,hints
/DEBUG: (bolt|bulge) being objhinted\.

@mis
#mistake retest for or do door
>rood
You already changed the odor, and this game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

@nud
#done rejects for OR DO door
>doro
The door is probably the way out. Best not change it into something else.
\\
#nudge for musical
>musicla
It's a pretty complex chord.
\\
#nudge for chord
>chodr
It's a pretty complex chord.
\\
#spechelp for bulge
>bugel
The bulge swells and makes a squeal, like it's trying to make music.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bulge. Keep at it.

@!min
>bugle
Your score has just gone up by one point.

@nud
#done rejects for bugle
>bugel
The bugle emits a sad "don't change me back" noise.
#nudge for horn
>honr
No, the bugle is a bugle, not just a horn. It's been changed enough.

@nud
#spechelp for bolt
>blto
You think back to a combination lock you had with, well, forty cubed possibilities. Only, hmm--twenty-four, here.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bolt. Keep at it.

Thickest Thickets

@hin
DEBUG: toga being objhinted.

@nud
#nudge for thickets

You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.

#nudge for darnel
>darnle
If it were just one darnel, there'd be no point in getting mad. But there are a bunch.
\\
#nudge for darnels
>darnesl
You might be able to clear the darnels a bit, but they're not as thick as, well, the thicket.

@mis
#mistake test for landers
>landers
There will be better hints than a manners advice column once you move on, though the darnels make you see red for a bit.
#mistake test for sandler
>sandler
I award you zero points for that anagramming try, and may God have mercy on your soul. Okay, actually, you're close to one point.

>slander
#notana

You already got mad at all the darnels. You need to move on

You already messed with the darnels.

#nudge for shrub
>shrbu
The shrub and brush waver, then point towards the toga.

@nud
#spechelp for toga
>gota
The toga blows in an unseen breeze, exposing what's written on it a bit more.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the toga. Keep at it.
#readables for toga
>read toga
A GOT-TA GO ... hmm, not the very best ever.

@nud
#mistake test for believe
>believe
Yes, but what do you believe you can do or change?
#mistake test for gato
>gato
Nice try, but wrong language. Another animal would be more likely to eat through the thickets.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

@hin
You can just go IN, now.

The goat is happy as-is. No need to go tag a ...

The remains of the shrub and brush waver, then point towards the opening in the thickets.

#readables for gateway
>read gateway
"E. g., man, TA!" is written in red, beneath the WARMUP/UM, WARP text.
Maybe it's significant that the writing's red, and that can help you
There's also a helpful ENTERING TOO SOON WILL NOT KILL YOU message, which is nice

You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. There's a hint device here that'll help, then.

@nud
#spechelp for static
>attisc
You think a bit, and the static seems like a bad extension to the doll house.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the static. Keep at it.

==t!1

Your score has just gone up by one point.

@nud
#spechelp for attics

Hm, you can't think of anything to do with the attics but change them back.

#mistake test for get a man

Very good. Very close. But here's a meta-nag: what kind of man? What would he work with?

>gateman
Your score has just gone up by one point.

@nud
#mistake retest for get a man

"Gateman, get a man, very clever. But thing is, you'll be working with things, not ideas or actions."

#nudge for warpy

You can't change Old Warpy. You have to just trust it.
#nudge for old

You can't change Old Warpy. You have to just trust it.
#nudge for oldman
>oldmna
He's too old to change. At least, in his present form.
#nudge for dollhouse
>dollhoues
Thinking that doesn't do much, but the attics seem to glow a bit.
#nudge for attic
>attci
You feel nothing from either attic. Perhaps you need to consider both the attics--though really, you don't see why you'd want to bring the static back.
#nudge for warmup
>warmpu
You can't change what's in the gateway. You just have to trust whatever is(n't) in there won't harm you.

@hin
You probably want to TAKE GADGET before entering the gate. Well, maybe even TAKE ALL.
>take gadget
It's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
You need to ASK GATEMAN ABOUT CABINET.
>undo

>ask gateman about cabinet
>take gadget

@hin
You can just enter the gate now.
>get saltine
Got it. You'd have liked a beefier freebie, but with calm opining, you see no use complaining.

#mistake test for remove [something] from [something]

To keep things simple for you (and, okay, for my coding efforts,) I recommend TAKE X instead of REMOVE/FROM. REMOVE defaults to carried or worn items, and I'm too lazy to tweak that.

"Hey, that's a good idea," says the gateman. "The cabinet's still recovering from its wounds. But it'll be seeing you again. When it does, I think Bactine will work." He pauses. "Oh. There probably won't be many brand names like that to worry about, unless they're even more ubiquitous. Like, say, Xerox."
