That way's an hour or two of listening to an under-action denunciator. You sure?
You sort of procrastinate the lecture, thinking it'd be fun to just ditch.
For all the lectures about new and exciting possibilities everyone should know about, you'd like one for your own.

Your eye catches the side passage, which looks more interesting than the standard ways out. Maybe you could give it a look.

Your magenta nametag is on securely enough. Not that you actually like having it on, but you'd get scolded for not having it.
>a magnet
You never need to use the article "a" when changing things up. In particular, "a magnet" is a good guess, but it's not what the nametag ultimately needs to be. Allowing a leading article might make puzzles potentially trickier, with two word jumbles to consider instead of one.

Some aftertaste from the saltine doesn't feel great. You wonder if this is the best way to use your vision. Use it anyway?
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see some Bactine.

As you pick it up, you see it's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
Nat Egam nods. "Take good care of it. Well, it's hard to break, so don't feel you'll wear it out. I'm proud of what I can make it do ... and  yet ... I have some ideas for a new version, maybe far in the future, if worse evil comes to Yorpwald. Anyhoo."

The cabinet's doors seem to waver a bit, but they don't slam on you.
You stare into the blue lube for a bit. You see a small story unfold.

And a few seconds later, he does. Well, the clairvoyance bit seems to work.
