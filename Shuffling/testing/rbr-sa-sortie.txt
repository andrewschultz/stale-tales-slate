`nu
#nudge for sortie
>tosrie
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#nudge for centrifuge

You're dizzy enough looking around without trying to focus on anything. The dial in the middle of the room seems to control it.
#nudge for frenetic
>frenetic
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room.
#nudge for sextien
>esxtien
The spinning seems to slow a bit.

A Round Den, Unadorned

#nudge for aroundden

>n

#nudge for kitchne
>ketchin
Nothing happens. Well, you didn't really want to go back to the nick, and there's probably no third room to look for between the two. Maybe you need to escape this bunker from another room.
