>pour oils
Gainly laying the cask under the spout, you pour in some oils.
A voice calls SO NOW HALLS SHALL SWOON. You're pretty sure it has a particular one in mind. You hope you've gotten what you need.


@max
>pour oils
The cask is already full of oils.

Really, they're oils. There's so much more you can do with oils than oil. Well, one more thing YOU can do.

Crashing Archings

Neither arching shakes. They're probably too sturdy, and you're probably not meant to go back.

#nudge for crashing
>crashign
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start constantly giving readings then, anyway.
\\
#nudge for rubble
>rubbel
The rubble is too dense to rearrange, physically or magically. You should have as much of the oils as you need.
\\
#renudge for trellis
>trellsi
You can't seem to start to reconstruct the trellis. You only hope your work in Sacred Cedars is done.

#done rejects for silo
>siol
That silo was pretty big. You probably have little more to do with the oils.

>put panel in silo
The panel fits into that rectangle handily and even starts to glow. Two buttons appear on it--one says HOOTS, the other TREES. "Panel fits. Final step," you muse.

>put door in silo
The door fits the dotted line in the silo perfectly, swinging slightly before sliding in place with a click.

"AMUSING GUNS! AIM!" The silo makes some ominous VVTT-KLK-BRRW noises and tilts slightly in the direction of what you assume and hope is Mean Old Mondale-Doleman's palace.
