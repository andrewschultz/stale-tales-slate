>opt in

>no entry
Hm, interesting. You wonder if anything is REALLY stopping you from entering.
>try
You're sure the lecture to the east will be about trying versus doing. Ugh. Maybe the sign means something different.

>x sign

>try
You're sure the lecture to the east will be about trying versus doing. Ugh.

>saltmine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?

>in
A Dry Yard

>try
That's more sensible than the five alternatives, but it's not concrete enough.

>no entry
You solved that puzzle already. Onward!

>dray
You don't have enough possessions to need a cart. You probably need somewhere to go, instead.

>rood
This game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

>doro
The odor doesn't seem too complex. You pause. You can figure what it should be.
>door
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>doro
The door is probably the way out. Best not change it into something else.

>rood
You already changed the odor, and this game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

>blto
You think back to a combination lock you had with, well, forty cubed possibilities. Only, hmm--twenty-four, here.
>blot
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>blto
You don't want to re-lock the door.

>bugel
The bulge swells and makes a squeal, like it's trying to make music.
>bugle
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>bugel
The bugle emits a sad "don't change me back" noise.

>use bugle
Use is a bit too general for this game's parser to understand. You can SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.

>in
Thickest Thickets

>believe
Yes, but what do you believe you can do?

>gato
Nice try, but wrong language. Another animal would be more likely to eat through the thickets.

>gota
The toga blows in an unseen breeze, exposing what's written on it a bit more.
>goat
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>gota
The goat seems content enough as-is.

>sandler
I award you zero points for that anagramming try, and may God have mercy on your soul. Okay, actually, you're close to one point.

>landers
There will be better hints than a manners advice column once you move on, though the darnels make you see red for a bit.

>slandre
You might be able to clear the darnels, but they're not as thick as, well, the thicket
>slander
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>slandre
You already messed with the darnels.

>landers
There will be better hints than a manners advice column once you move on.

>sandler
I award you zero points for that anagramming try, and may God have mercy on your soul for trying to sneak another point.

>in

>get phial

>bactine
The cabinet bit you, but there was no lasting damage.

>attisc
You think a bit, and the static seems like a bad extension to the doll house.
>attics
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>attisc
Hm, you can't think of anything to do with the attics but change them back.

>magnet
A magnet is two words--but "a" doesn't fully count.

>get a man
Very good. Very close. But here's a meta-nag: what kind of man? What would he work with?

>gatemna
The nametag peels infinitesimally.
>gateman
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>gatemna
Don't scramble the gateman. He's here to help.

>ask gateman about xyzzy
"Fool! That magic word has no place alongside your magic abilities."

>ask gateman about next guy
"Optimistic, aren't we?"

>ask gateman about sane sean
The gateman shakes his head slowly and shrugs. Sane Sean would probably be a lot funnier if Yorpwald weren't in trouble.

>ask gateman about advice
"Well, you figured a few things out. Probably want to focus more on changing stuff than weird actions. One thing, though. The things you need to change? Nothing too complex. Nothing over eight letters. Okay, maybe one two-word thing with nine. Red Bull Burdell often babbled about getting eighteen intelligence and wisdom from all that leveling up, but he never got a decent vocabulary. The philistine. Also, there will be clues--clues that seem all wrong, deliberately wrong, but their wrongness will stand out and help you."

>ask gateman about clods
Like I said, no time for that. Time to fix things!"

>ask gateman about world
"Well, it wasn't a very SPECIAL world. In fact it was one of those hero mills. I remember more hills than anything else. Figure it had to break down for the next guy to save it."

>ask gateman about yorpwald
"It's been shuffled, nearly f-flushed! You can rescue it from physical, economic and moral malaise. You will need to travel through Old Warpy to get there. The stuff in the cabinet should help. Ask me about it. I'm a hero emeritus, and stuff."

>ask gateman about old warpy
"Once you step in, it'll take you somewhere far away. But it's perfectly harmless and not too bumpy. Like beyond that gateway getaway. Terry's in there, too, and he flips the switch so you can RETRY if you get stuck somewhere."

>ask gateman about terry
"He's reliable."

>ask gateman about lupine lineup
Distant rumblings from somewhere beyond a very quiet place. Sadly, violence may be necessary."

>ask gateman about noble
"He used to be fair and just. But he saw Red Bull Burdell 'leveling up,' whatever that is. Red Bull bragged about how he'd multiplied his gold and achieved eighteen charisma, or something, before changing Noble Ol' Ben."

>ask gateman about quest
"Three major problems past the gateway. Noise is one. A lupine lineup. Noble Ol' Ben: gone. Lorn. No longer."
"And I think I know who's behind it: RED BULL BURDELL!"

>ask gateman about quest
He mentions "Noise is one, lupine lineup, Noble Ol' Ben gone, lorn, no longer." Then he motions to the gateway. "You'll see when you get there, I think."

>ask gateman about schtuff
"Eh?! There's all sorts of things to ask me about! That goat back there! Your quest! Your purpose! The getaway! General advice! No time to scold clods asking about--whatever you just mumbled about."

>ask gateman about schtuff
Old Man Almond pauses. "There's so much in the world we all want to understand. But unfortunately, we only have time for the questy stuff. So ask me about that goat, your quest, your purpose, general advice. Or--well, just go through the gateway once you change it. It's not too hard, for seven letters, but I can't tell you. You'll learn by doing."

>ask gateman about redness
"Red writing, like Red Bull Burdell, is totally wrong in many ways. So many, it can be a help."

He shows you some calculations that any such writing can be expected to eliminate 60% of your possible choices, because 1 minus 1/x to the x is 1/e, more if there's a duplicate letter--the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle applies here, and you nod as he mentions the exact numbers aren't important, but every clue helps.
[You record the information about red in your notepad.]

>ask gateman about board
"Good idea to take notes on it. But I can tell you about other stuff. Like the gadget in the cabinet. Or even how it works."

>ask gateman about doll house
"You don't need to take it with or anything. Nice job with it, though."

>ask gateman about static
"Good job getting rid of it."

>ask gateman about attics
"They're more appropriate to the doll house, definitely."

>ask gateman about blue lube
"Cabinet not letting you have it, eh? The phial with the lube can grease your way to a solution." He coughs. "Sorry."

"If you ANGLE the lube just right so it reflects a light source, you can see what you can change. If you GLEAN, you see what you should be doing. How your story unfolds." He walks over to the cabinet, pats it, and says a few words. "You can take the phial now."

[You record the information about lube/angle/glean in multiple entries in your notepad.]

>ask gateman about phail phial
"Good, good, you got the phial. Remember to ANGLE to see into things or GLEAN to see around as need be."

>ask gateman about prep paper
"No, I'm not sure how we all know this. There's a lot of high-level magic theory. And if we knew the details and had your powers, maybe one of us could try. But--well, it's a start."

>ask gateman about Red Bull Burdell
"Like he was thought up by a demonic comedian. Made a desireable age disagreeable. Seemed a poseur when he uprose from abuser to saboteur. He'd make a poignant nag point, acting like a rowdy pal. Heard his cleats in the castle as he did something called "Leveling up." Maximizing stuff called hit points and magic points. Things went awry before we were wary." You sense there's more, if you can bear it.

>ask gateman about tip
"Scan something. Like that doll house. Or even me. Then come back and ask for details. You're an adventurer...do a little experimenting. The gadget won't explode, trust me." It shouldn't be too hard to humor him.

>ask gateman about tinfoil info-lit
"Sane Sean. Hmph. Either he's dumb enough to believe Red Bull Burdell's a good guy, or he's a deep undercover double agent."

>ask gateman about Bud Helm
"Yeah, we were surprised the bum held Bud Helm.  Bud Helm bled, hum? He's a broken man, now."

>ask gateman about Raw Rori
"Pure strength. That won't get the job done here."

>ask gateman about pen
"How thoughtful! Nobody's asked me for my autograph for a long time! Wait, we don't have time for that nonsense."

>ask gateman about dope tan notepad
"Good choice, taking notes."

>ask gateman about new land
"I can't tell you everything about it. But you'll see for yourself."

>ask gateman about nametag
"Oh, did you have problems with it? Sorry. I'd have helped, but I was--I mean, I wasn't at all." He rolls his eyes.

>ask gateman about yourself
"We need someone to free us from the marauding tyranny of Red Bull Burdell! He has made a plowyard out of Yorpwald! Force alone cannot undo him!"

>ask gateman about gateman
"Once I solved one of those hero mills with more hills..." he blinks. "I'm not important. You are. And what you can do."

 >ask gateman about arrow
"Scan something. Like that doll house. Or even me. Then come back and ask for details. You're an adventurer...do a little experimenting. The gadget won't explode, trust me." It shouldn't be too hard to humor him.

>ask gateman about knot
"Scan something. Like that doll house. Or even me. Then come back and ask for details. You're an adventurer...do a little experimenting. The gadget won't explode, trust me." It shouldn't be too hard to humor him.

>ask gateman about examples
"Hm, LEMON and MELON have three letters in common, and they're all green. The two that switch are red. So that's not bad. PASTE and TAPES, on the other hand...the green T and red S on the left map to the first last letters on the right, and the P and E are green and red and map to the first and last letters on the left."

>ask gateman about disclaimer
"Necessary legalese. But really, use the gadget as often or little as you want or need. Nobody will judge."

>ask gateman about gadget screen
"Scan something. Like that doll house. Or even me. Then come back and ask for details. You're an adventurer...do a little experimenting. The gadget won't explode, trust me." It shouldn't be too hard to humor him.

>ask gateman about handle
"Scan something. Like that doll house. Or even me. Then come back and ask for details. You're an adventurer...do a little experimenting. The gadget won't explode, trust me." It shouldn't be too hard to humor him.

>ask gateman about goat
"Hm, yes, good job with the goat. It'll be safe and happy. Oh, for the record, the gadget would've said Red-Green-Red-Red in Certify mode and Red-Blue-Green-Blue in Rectify."

>ask gateman about toga
You don't wish to revisit past glories. It's probably better to PAD GOAT for Old Man Almond's information.

>ask gateman about shrub
You don't wish to revisit past glories. It's probably better to PAD GOAT for Old Man Almond's information.

>ask gateman about brush
You don't wish to revisit past glories. It's probably better to PAD GOAT for Old Man Almond's information.

>ask gateman about thorn
"Sorry if it scratched you. And by you I mean your nametag. And by your nametag I mean me."

>ask gateman about getaway
"I'd get that gadget in the cabinet before entering. I can help, if you ask. But I can't force you to do anything."

>ask gateman about gadget
"Scan something. Like that doll house. Or even me. Then come back and ask for details. You're an adventurer...do a little experimenting. The gadget won't explode, trust me." It shouldn't be too hard to humor him.

>ask gateman about secure button
"Scan something. Like that doll house. Or even me. Then come back and ask for details. You're an adventurer...do a little experimenting. The gadget won't explode, trust me." It shouldn't be too hard to humor him.

>ask gateman about noise bag
"Cities gotta have noise but there's one just constantly has it. Burdell's behind it, too, claiming he couldn't have leveled up without that techno-piffle and people get used to it if they try. Actually calls it music. He's got a lieutenant to enforce it."

>ask gateman about saltine
"Miniscule, but more than mini-clues. The next item that baffles you, eat that and eXamine extra hard and it'll make sense. Oh, apologies in advance: good flavors and good magic don't mix."

>ask gateman about cabinet
"Everything in there's yours."

>remove gadget from cabinet
To keep things simple, I recommend TAKE as a synonym. REMOVE is also okay, but it defaults to carried or worn items, and I know no way around that.

>get gadget

Anything you do to bend the shades might break them.

>padres
Bringing holy men down here would probably kill them.
>rasped
The spread makes a raspy noise, but you probably need to think up something more concrete. Not, like, cement concrete.
>spader
James Spader is pretty cool, but he can't help with supernatural stuff. Okay, maybe he could, but I couldn't afford the appearance fee.

>mope
Woeful Pat can't decide if you're mocking him or trying to outdo him. But he is sure you're not listening carefully enough to his poem, so he coughs briefly to get your attention.

>ask woeful pat about beat
He holds up his hand for silence. He is too busy reciting his poem. You probably can't ask him about anything other than the poem. Or maybe its meter.

He mumbles "Mt. Rose Rots Me Moster" and giggles stupidly. You probably won't learn much from him except about instruments of subversion.

Perhaps you are the word smyth who will fulfill the sword myth! We offer a flower of your choice. But only one. And take the brocade, too. Our flowers, or what you make of them, cannot provoke or participate in violence, but they may be able to contain the weapon you need."

"Well, if they found their way in, they can't be THAT dumb!"

"Well, they'll have to find the right thing to ASK NERDS like us about if they want us to stop talking about them like they's not here."

"Maybe they's a lateral thinker. Who knows several ways to get through things."

"GROAN! Nice Ignorance."

They don't seem to want to tell you what to ask them, out of principle, but if you keep nagging them, they may let some cryptic knowledge slip.

"If they doen't know what to ask nerds about, they deserve ED'S SNARK!" Ed, indistinguishable otherwise from the rest, leaps, pleased with what elapsed.

>ask about xyzzy
More annoying banter. Perhaps you could disperse them with the right item. They'd deserve it.

>ask about xyzzy
Laugh-tons onslaught as you haven't figured what to ask nerds.

A hundred-nerd DUH follow your latest ask-nerds attempt.

>ask about xyzzy
"Maroon! A moron! You might as well ask dorks like Karkdoss about something that inconsequential!"

>ask about xyzzy
An argument on the virtues of code versus Frisbee golf follows, and how nobody would ask geeks like Kaergess for help getting better at either.

>ask about xyzzy
The nerds jokingly offer to send Sark in your place, maybe to find a left-handed veeblefitzer. You see red at the backhanded insult.

>ask about xyzzy
Apparently you haven't seen the light for what to ask nerds about. "We can wait here a thousand years!" one laughs. They debate on what's worse, dumb people in power or out.

>ask about xyzzy
One nerd tells you you should be sent to the red planet of SKASDREN for asking so many nagging questions.

>ask about xyzzy
One nerd calculates eight factorial over two factorial, that's 20160, and eventually you'll see the light.

The nerds might be experts on technical stuff, but they'd be over your head.
