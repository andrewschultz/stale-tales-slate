There's not much to do here, but EXAMINEing different things may give you a clue what's going on. This is a part of all the puzzles in the game, but you'll have to do other things, too.
Note: If you want actual hints, you may wish to try HINT or HINTS.

>pad lecture
An hour-long pre-lunch lecture by some fellow named Curt Lee netted you three pages of doodles. You remember him saying how ONE WORD could open a NEW DOOR in this age of technological innovation if you picked the right one, and that's more magic than real magic, if real magic existed, which it doesn't.

But hey, at least lunch was nice.

>x tag
It's stuck to your shirt, all right. Somehow, you got a magenta one while most other people got plain white. It just took a tame nag to put it on, and you hate it but can't bring yourself to pull it off in public.

It does not make you feel like a powerful magnate, that's for sure.

You consult your notepad but haven't figured any flips in advance yet.


>consult pad
Currently you can consult the notepad about:
--notepad, verbs, options, access.
--lecture.

>exist
You continue to exist. Perhaps this ability will come in handy some day.

>scan
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a list of common verbs, type VERBS.
>c

>in

>x smell
It's an odor of new places and adventure and puzzles and how to get there. It tempts you--wouldn't it be nice if there was something more physical to provide passage than, well, just an odor?

You repress a four-letter word. Well, if things are that simple, it's probably a nicer four-letter word.

You imagine a swordsman changing to sandworms, and back.

>x breeze
It's an odor of new places and adventure and puzzles and how to get there. It tempts you--wouldn't it be nice if there was something more physical to provide passage than, well, just an odor?

You repress a four-letter word. Well, if things are that simple, it's probably a nicer four-letter word.

You confuse latitude and altitude for a second. Odd.

>door

>unlock door
No keyholes. Maybe you can break it down some other way?

>hint door
You can just ENTER the door once you figure how to open it.
>hint blot
I couldn't find anything like that to hint.

>hint bugle
I couldn't find anything like that to hint.

>blot
>bugle
>x horn
It's brass, you guess, and it probably can't be too hard to play.

>x doorway
WRONG

>blow pad
It really only makes sense to BLOW an instrument. Well, CLEAN sense.
>blow bugle
 The note from the bugle causes the door to swing back and forth, just as when you got rid of the bolt.
 >play pad
That's not an instrument you can play.

> *play bugle*
Nothing further happens.

>play bugle
WRONG

>x doorway
WRONG

>in
>x toga
On it you see a four-legged animal with a sort of beard and horns. It's not very clear, but there are only so many possibilities--and if you read the toga, maybe you can see what's written on it.

>read toga
It's a dingy grey and says "You GOT A believe!" You'd expect that sort of excruciating grammar on a sports team's t-shirt, but not a toga. Hmm.

>x thickest
Well, they're tangled enough, you'd probably get hurt going through them.
>x thickets
Well, they're tangled enough, you'd probably get hurt going through them.
>x thickest thickets
Well, they're tangled enough, you'd probably get hurt going through them.

>goat

>pat goat
It doesn't seem to realize it did anything for you. It's probably still confused. Probably irritable from eating all those big gigantic thickets. Don't fluster the restful.
>pet goat
Don't fluster the restful.
>stroke goat
Don't fluster the restful.

>kick goat
That'd be cruel. He's a lazy sort of ornery, not violent.
>kick me
I hope it's not the puzzles that made you try this.

>x animal
It seems ill-tempered despite, or perhaps because of, its eclectic recent meal.

>in

>x billboard

You hear a big VOOP. The writing on the board is replaced by even more writing, but not before you write some basic stuff down in your notepad.
[You record the information about retry in your notepad.]
