There's not much to do here, but EXAMINEing different things may give you a clue what's going on. This is a part of all the puzzles in the game, but you'll have to do other things, too.
Note: If you want actual hints, you may wish to try HINT or HINTS.

>pad lecture
An hour-long pre-lunch lecture by some fellow named Curt Lee netted you three pages of doodles. You remember him saying how ONE WORD could open a NEW DOOR in this age of technological innovation if you picked the right one, and that's more magic than real magic, if real magic existed, which it doesn't.

But hey, at least lunch was nice.

>x tag
It's stuck to your shirt, all right. Somehow, you got a magenta one while most other people got plain white. It just took a tame nag to put it on, and you hate it but can't bring yourself to pull it off in public.

It does not make you feel like a powerful magnate, that's for sure.

>x smell
It's an odor of new places and adventure and puzzles and how to get there. It tempts you--wouldn't it be nice if there was something more physical to provide passage than, well, just an odor?

You repress a four-letter word. Well, if things are that simple, it's probably a nicer four-letter word.

You imagine a swordsman changing to sandworms, and back.

>x breeze

You confuse latitude and altitude for a second. Odd.

>door

>unlock door
No keyholes. Maybe you can break it down some other way?

>hint door
You can just ENTER the door once you figure how to open it.
>hint blot
I couldn't find anything like that to hint.

>hint bugle
I couldn't find anything like that to hint.

>blot
>bugle
>x horn
It's brass, you guess, and it probably can't be too hard to play.

>x doorway
It's got a big musical chord painted on the front above where the bulge was. It's covered by a blot, too. You have no clue where the door could lead now you've opened it.

>blow pad
It really only makes sense to BLOW an instrument. Well, CLEAN sense.
>blow bugle
 The note from the bugle causes the door to swing back and forth, just as when you got rid of the bolt.
 >play pad
That's not an instrument you can play.

>play bugle
Nothing further happens.

>x doorway
It's really just the outline of a doorway now. You can just enter it.

>in
>x toga
On it you see a four-legged animal with a sort of beard and horns. It's not very clear, but there are only so many possibilities--and if you read the toga, maybe you can see what's written on it.

>read toga
It's a dingy grey and says "You GOT A believe!" You'd expect that sort of excruciating grammar on a sports team's t-shirt, but not a toga. Hmm.

>x thickest
Well, they're tangled enough, you'd probably get hurt going through them.
>x thickets

>x thickest thickets

>pat goat
The goat is off in dreamland and doesn't need disturbing after that meal, whether it was good or bad. Don't fluster the restful.
>pet goat
Don't fluster the restful.
>stroke goat
Don't fluster the restful.
>kick goat
Don't fluster the restful.

>kick me
I hope it's not the puzzles that made you try this.

>x animal
It seems ill-tempered despite, or perhaps because of, its eclectic recent meal.

>in

>x billboard

You hear a big VOOP. The writing on the board is replaced by even more writing, but not before you write some basic stuff down in your notepad.
[You record the information about retry in your notepad.]


>x gate
You can't see a lot. It's dark and murky.  It says GETAWAY at the top, WARMUP on the side facing you and UM, WARP on the other, but there's a little something else to READ.

Maybe you'll spend long enough there, your severance check'll make it to your mailbox before you get back.

>read gate
"E. g., man, TA!" is written in red, beneath the WARMUP/UM, WARP text. The red text is just like A TAN GEM and such on the broad board. There's also a helpful ENTERING TOO SOON WILL NOT KILL YOU message, which is nice.

>lift gateway
It's open. It's just unclear where it leads.

>enter gateway
>x mega-ant
Boy, is it bright red! And fierce! It's clicking aggressively at you.

>x noise
It's not especially painful to listen to, but you probably don't have to.

>attics
>x attic
They fit perfectly on what was once the top of the house. Maybe there's no way a doll could get there, but the house looks nicer now.
>x dollhouse
It's much nicer and quieter now that you tacked the attics on.

>gateman

>talk to gateman
You engage in small talk, which peters out. Perhaps you should ASK about something, instead.

"Eh?! There's all sorts of things to ask me about! That goat back there! Your quest! Your purpose! The getaway! General advice! No time to scold clods asking about--whatever you just mumbled about."

>x man
"Stop staring!" he booms. "You should probably get equipped. Get the gadget in the cabinet."
>x gate man
"Stop staring!" he booms. "You should probably get equipped. Get the gadget in the cabinet."

>x fellow

>talk to gateman about gadget
"Scan something. Like that doll house. Or even me. Then come back and ask for details. You're an adventurer...do a little experimenting. The gadget won't explode, trust me." It shouldn't be too hard to humor him.

>walkthrough
This game's gblorb file should come packaged with an InvisiClues-style HTML file and, in older versions, a text file called walkthrough.txt. However, there is a risk that will spoil a lot you won't want, especially since the areas are compartmentalized.

You can ask for hints with the HINT command--they should deal with the puzzle currently restricting you the most and may be doled out slowly to avoid spoilers.

>xx store i
Store I has pictures of famous political figures in the window--Winston Churchill, Benjamin Disraeli and that great charmer, Margaret Thatcher (*). You think you remember what party they belonged to. The pictures are big enough to obscure--almost--the outline of a trap door behind them.
[NOTE: this is not a political statement on their party.]
>xx store i
!this is not a political statement on their party
>eat saltine
You're not sure what the saltine is supposed to do, but your vision looks a little weirder after eating it. Some things seem especially sharp if you stare doubly hard at them.
>xx store i
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see a sortie.
You blink, and things look a little less sharp. The saltine's done its work.
>xx store m
You lost your x-ray vision, so you can only just examine, instead.

There's no window in store m--just a detailed map of a subway.

You can X STORES to examine all the stores.

>parse
The game is now parsing output from the gadget.
>scan f
Before scanning for the first time, you fumble with the gadget and note it is set to CERTIFY.
The gadget beeps once. A series of lights comes across: RRRRRR (R = red, G = green). Hmm, that means ------.
You can toggle spaces between the letters with SPACE(S), or you can set them directly with SPACE(S) ON/NO SPACE(S), or SON/NOS for short.

#### extra space??

>x device
It looks like a wall stud sensor, six inches by twelve, with a screen on the top. A show hows tag you can read is tied by a tight knot to the handle, which narrows where it meets the main part. The gadget crackles with greeny energy. A tip in a pit on one of its edges points to RECTIFY.

You see a blurb above a button labeled SECURE/RECUSE.
