You mess around with all the possibilities for a bit
[NOTE: this was the right idea, though what you tried to switch can't be anagrammed. Trying stuff is encouraged, though generally, you'll get a response saying nothing meaningful happens if you try to change scenery that doesn't need it.]

There's no secret command between ANGLE and GLEAN that gives special clues.

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-phail

Whatever organic compounds exist in the blue lube or PHAIL phial don't need rearranging. That stuff's beyond you. They will help you when you want or need it. You just need to GLEAN or ANGLE.

The saltine's there to help you. Changing it might work against you.

>rerty
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a list of common verbs, type VERBS.

>x broad board

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-retry
>rerty
You consider trying to mess with RETRY to wind up somewhere that will cut out a few puzzles, but it might cut out a few items you need to solve other puzzles. So, no.

#renudge for yorpwald
>yorpwadl
You'll need to change Yorpwald one anagram at a time.

>reaves
You don't need to break anything up, medieval or otherwise. You're trying to bring things and people back together.

>gonear means manse

>anme
You need to act on the Means Manse in their entirety. Or the exits.
[NOTE: you are on the right track, but you'll need an extra S for what you need to figure, here. This is a one-time nag, though the nudge messages should always implicitly state when things' or people's plurality is important.]

>anme
