You haven't solved any regions yet.

[NOTE: You can toggle seeing the minimum points to pass an area, or maximum achievable points, by typing POSS. This is a potential spoiler, since the minimum score increasing indicates you found a Last Lousy Point, and the maximum score decreasing indicates one is no longer available. But maybe you'd like that sort of hint, too.]

>pad poss
POSS toggles if you see the possible minimum and maximum scores on solving a region. It's a small spoiler/clue for last lousy points.

>ask gateman about tip
"Well, one of rectify or certify is overall better than the other. Would you like to know which?"
"Without getting too mathy, you can expect one of the letters to CERTIFY correctly if there are no repeats, but a bit more with repeats--one and a half, in an eight-letter word with a repeat. RECTIFY, you're always guaranteed the first and last right. So it's a bit more help if you SECURE later. But how much challenge you want is up to you. Either can work with any red writing you might see."

[You record the information about certify/rectify in multiple entries in your notepad.]

>ask about certify
"Tells you what letters are right for what something should be. Red is wrong, green is right. Probably not as powerful as rectifying, but gets you some stuff right away. Also--there's some clues out there that're just plain red. They're all wrong."

>ask gateman about redness
"Red writing, like Red Bull Burdell, is totally wrong in many ways. So many, it can be a help."

He shows you some calculations that any such writing can be expected to eliminate 60% of your possible choices, because 1 minus 1/x to the x is 1/e, more if there's a duplicate letter--the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle applies here, and you nod as he mentions the exact numbers aren't important, but every clue helps.
[You record the information about red in your notepad.]

>pad redness
Any words that are red, or make you see red, or make people turn red, are all wrong, just like Red Bull Burdell. This is handy to know--what do you need to mess with? And how shouldn't it be messed with?

>ask gateman about saltine
"Miniscule, but more than mini-clues. The next item that baffles you, eat that and eXamine extra hard and it'll make sense. Oh, apologies in advance: good flavors and good magic don't mix."

[You record the information about xx in your notepad.]

>pad xx
You can XX after you eat the saltine in order to see what an item should be. This has one use, and benign items do not waste it.

Old Man Almond coughs. "You might want to save that. It'll help you later, with a real puzzle, if you eXamine double hard. The static is just practice."

(NOTE: when using CERTIFY, you can shorten it to CERT/CER/C in the future.)

The gadget beeps once. A series of lights comes across: RGRRRR.

>rectify static
(switching to rectify first)(NOTE: when using RECTIFY, you can shorten it to RECT/REC/R in the future.)

Most of the screen goes blue. Then a green dot and red dot bounce left and right across the gadget screen until they stabilize: RBGBBB.  (R = red, G = green, B = blue).

>ask gateman about blue lube
"The phial with the lube can grease your way to a solution." He coughs. "Sorry."

"If you ANGLE the lube just right so it reflects a light source, you can see what you can change. If you GLEAN, you see what you should be doing. How your story unfolds." He walks over to the cabinet, pats it, and says a few words. "You can take the phial now."

>x examples
CERTIFY: LEMON <-> MELON. A little thought and you realize only two reds on the gadget makes things trivial.

RECTIFY: PASTE <-> TAPES. The red S/green T in PASTE and green P/red E in TAPES are, you realize, the first and last letters in the other word.

>access
>x examples
CERTIFY: LEMON, two way arrow, and MELON. The m's and l's are red, but the other letters are green.

RECTIFY: PASTE, two-way arrow, TAPES. The ST of paste is red and green, with the PE of tapes being green and red. Hm, Tapes starts with T and ends with S, while Paste starts with P and ends with E.

>ask gateman about goat
"Hm, yes, good job with the goat. It'll be safe and happy. Oh, for the record, the gadget would've said Red-Green-Red-Red in Certify mode and Red-Blue-Green-Blue in Rectify."

[You record the information about the goat in your notepad.]

>pad goat
Certify = RGRR and Rectify = RBGB.

>eat writing
There's a lot of writing in this game, especially red writing. If you're trying to read writing, you may want to READ what the writing is on, instead. This is slight laziness on my part, but it's tricky code. I hope you understand.

You don't have to do anything with any writing, just READ whatever the writing is on. That said, sorry for not implementing any and all writing fully.

>ask gateman about red bull burdell
"Like he was thought up by a demonic comedian. Made a desireable age disagreeable. Seemed a poseur when he uprose from abuser to saboteur. He'd make a poignant nag point, acting like a rowdy pal. Heard his cleats in the castle as he did something called "Leveling up." Maximizing stuff called hit points and magic points. Things went awry before we were wary." You sense there's more, if you can bear it.

They're labelled with letters, not numbers, though you can refer to them by number if you want. Of the various stores you see, only store M, Store I and Store F look like you can do anything with them. Store B looks--well, not quite dead, but not very substantial, either. Store R has COMING SOON spray-painted to the side it. A few others seem greyed-out, like in a video game or something. There can't be anything in any of them.

>pad secure
Having SECURE activated will make the gadget less useful on any one puzzle but will let you skip a chunk of your quest later. SECURE will be locked once you visit certain places. The button will flash when you need to choose.

>pad recuse
If you secured, RECUSE will come in handy once you've solved two quests, to skip a third.

You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. You notice weird hazes around Store R, store M, Store I, Store F and Store B when you do.

You stare into the blue lube for a bit. You see a small story unfold.

You see yourself walking into woods instead of store F. Well, not quite woods. You think you hear lumber rumble.

After this vision, you shake your head a bit on seeing yourself taking six foot-high letters labeled ANGLE and crumpling them into AN. Then you do the same for GLEAN, which folds to GL. (Fourth wall time, to be clear--you can use four abbreviations, now.)

>pad macros
ANGLE=AN to see changeable items, GLEAN=GL to see the story ahead.

[NOTE: You can toggle detailed nudges when you're on the right track with OPT IN (to get them) and NO TIP (to hide them,) though they may give more hints than you want. You will always get this generic message, at least, in any case.]

OPT IN gives you more detail when you are on the right track. NO TIP gives you less detail but lets you know you have the right anagram.
