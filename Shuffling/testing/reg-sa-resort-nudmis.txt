#spechelp for store r
>resotr
Store R remains impassive. "Or rest?" you muse. You're sort of ready for vacation, and sort of not.

>resort
#notmax
Your score has just gone up by one point

#done rejects for ogled lodge
>resotr
You already made passage to the ogled lodge. It's good enough. Why change it?

>enter resort
Astral Altars

#mistake test for lites
>lites
Light isn't the problem here. It's not having anywhere to go.
#mistake test for slite
>slite
That's bad spelling, and it won't shrink your problems.

#nudge for astral
>astrla
While there doesn't seem to be much to do here, you don't need to do anything to the location name. The stile and tiles may be more useful.
#nudge for altar
>altra
While there doesn't seem to be much to do here, you don't need to do anything to the location name. The stile and tiles may be more useful.
#nudge for resort
>resotr
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#nudge for islet
>tilse
The tiles rattle as if to shift but settle down.
#nudge for tile
>tiel
You need to deal with all the tiles.
#nudge for flare
>s
>flaer
The feral flare crackles menacingly. You doubt you can change it for the better.
#spechelp for tiles
>islte
The tiles rattle as if to shift but settle down.
#readables for tiles
>read tiles
The tiles blur a bit as you (de)-focus just right. You see subtleties in the blues and brown that seem to spell out LEST I. But with the effort, your eyes water, and you see red a bit.
#renudge for altar
>altra
While you're sort of trapped here, you don't need to do anything to the location name. The stile and tiles may be more useful.

>islet
Your score has just gone up by one point.

Leis Isle

>score
You currently have 1 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 10, and the maximum is 15

#mistake test for download
>download
The woodland appears to glitch in and out like a loaded JPEG. It doesn't seem fully real
!But then, since the leis were fake, you shouldn't be surprised the woodland is, too.
>download
You wait for the woodland to download fully, but it doesn't. Well, maybe that's what you get for playing a text adventure.
>lies
>download
But then, since the leis were fake, you shouldn't be surprised the woodland is, too.
>undo
>undo

#nudge for woodland
>wooldand
The woodland can't be the way out. The isle is too small. There's enough outside the woodland to look at, anyway.

#nudge for and
>adn
The sand and sands and sands are just--well, sand. They won't help you get off the island.

#nudge for sands
>sansd
The sand and sands and sands are just--well, sand. They won't help you get off the island.
#spechelp for l2
>lesi
You feel about to reveal an uncomfortable untruth, yet you also feel a bit of relief.

#nudge for lie
>eil
Perhaps you can deal with the leis, or maybe you can use something else to escape the isle.

#nudge for sand
>sadn
The sand and sands and sands are just--well, sand. They won't help you get off the island.

#renudge for islet
>tilse
That's how you got here, twiddling items in the Astral Altars. But you have new things to play with so you can leave.

#nudge for eter
>eter
The tree sits there, but the swing rocks a bit.

#nudge for oflat
>aftol
You notice writing on the rock and swing similar to what you just said. Or tried to say. Also, no need to make anything lo-fat here.

#spechelp for rock
>crko
Hmm, a rock, but only so much you can do with it.

>lies
by one point
>score
You currently have 2 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 11, and the maximum is 15

#note that there is no renudge for leis because before L2 is moot, we go to the table of spechelp. But for lei, we are always in the table of nudges.
#nudge for leis
>isel
You already noticed the leis. Use something on the isle to escape it.
#renudge for lie
>iel
You already noticed the leis. Use something on the isle to escape it.

#mistake test for lies/lie
>lies
You reflect on how insidious it was to stick you here in a false paradise.
>lie
You reflect on how insidious it was to stick you here in a false paradise.

>cork
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 3 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 11, and the maximum is 15

#done rejects for cork
>crko
Your head swims then sinks as you realize the cork can't become much else.

#renudge for oflat
>aftol
You have a way off this island to the east, though you can make the other for fun, too. Also, no need to make anything lo-fat here.

#spechelp for swing
>winsg
The swing goes slightly airborne.

>wings
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>score
You currently have 4 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 12, and the maximum is 15

#done rejects for wings
>winsg
The wings should be able to propel you enough.

#renudge for oflat
>aftol
You can just use either the cork or the wings to leave to the east.

#renudge for eter
>eter
The tree sits there.

>e
Rived Drive

#mistake test for repos
>repos
You resolve to organize your programming code better once this adventure is over.

#mistake test for verdi
>verdi
You don't need a musical score for this adventure.

#mistake test for diver
>diver
But you just got by a lot of water. No need to go back in.

#nudge for blow
>blwo
You don't need to make any blow bowl more chaotic.

#nudge for drive
>driev
There is too much lying around here to mess with the Rived Drive's name.

#nudge for tool
>loto
Hm, no, the whole tool shed.

#nudge for shed
>shde
Hm, no, the whole tool shed.

#nudge for ashed

>windwo

#nudge for windows
>windwos
They remain still. Maybe the toolshed itself.

#nudge for ulock
>ulokc
Nope. That lock's secure.

#nudge for lock
>lokc
Nope. That lock's secure.

#nudge for pole
>pelo
Only changing one pole would still leave a vertical barrier.

#spechelp for poles
>polse
The poles start to bend at an angle--or maybe that's the light.

#mistake test for prose
>prose
There's not much of that left in this game, and more of it won't help you up the poles. The spore can be something sturdier. You see red wondering what.

>slope
by one point

>score
You currently have 5 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 12, and the maximum is 15

#done rejects for slope

Almost. But you don't need to create holes.

#mistake test for poser
>poser
You wonder if YOU are the poser, for not being able to figure what to do.

#spechelp for tool shed
>toeholsd
You hear an unseen hinge neigh as if in defiance. You may be getting somewhere, here.
#readables for u lock
>read u lock
Red writing shows the U-Lock brand is OLD THOSE.

>toeholds
Your score has just gone up by two points.

>score
You currently have 7 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 12, and the maximum is 15

#done rejects for toeholds
>toeholsd
The toeholds could be handy for getting up and out of here.

#spechelp for spore
>respo
You briefly wonder what the spore could grow into, given time. Time you don't have. Maye something circular, or something long and stringy.

>ropes
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 8 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 13, and the maximum is 15

#mistake retest for prose
>prose
There's not much of that left in this game, and more of it won't help you up the slope. The ropes will.

#mistake retest for poser
>poser
You mutter a small epithet at where Red Bull Burdell could be. No, he's not around, but he must be near.

#mistake retest for pores
>pores
No, you had it.

#done rejects for ropes
>respo
The ropes are useful for climbing, which you need to do to get east.

#nudge for rope
>repo
Those are already useful.

#spechelp for sprig
>grisp
The sprig seems to grow less fragile for a moment.

#mistake test for prigs

Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 9 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 14, and the maximum is 15

>grisp
You can't get ahold of anything that would be more useful than the grips.

#nudge for grip
>pirg
Those are already useful.

>e

#nudge for protesters
>ersprotest
They're just a simple protest.

>ether
They're not bad people

>ethre
The trio remains unmoved. Perhaps you can give the protest more constructive aims?

#spechelp for protest
>pottesr
The protesters mumble at you for trying to exert mind control. You've struck a nerve.

#mistake test for roister
>roister
That's what's causing the riot, and it's up to you to quiet the rioters--well, the riot.

#mistake test for spotter

You're overthinking it. Or you hope you are. It's both a chain, and links.

#mistake test for slink
>slink
Too many people are watching for you to slink away.

#nudge for scar
>scar
No time for cosmetic changes.

#nudge for crass

#mistake test for morans/moran
>morans
A long-haired fellow wearing a St. Louis Cardinals t-shirt and an American flag bandana appears, holds up a sign saying GET A BRAIN, and vanishes. Whoah! That was random!

#mistake test for retest
>retest
Oh, wow! Do you really want to play through again? I'm flattered!

#mistake test for romans
>romans
It's a pretty ritzy area. It doesn't need sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, or public health.

#mistake test for tester
>tester
Your tester, Red Bull Burdell, is vanquished. Let's keep it that way.
On the other hand, if you're volunteering to test my other games, I could always use the help.

Means Manse

#nudge for manse
>mesna

#nudge for extis
>extis
That's not quite the right sort of nothing.

>blamer
No, we know who's to blame. He's done with. Time to move on.
#mistake test for mensa
>mensa
No, you couldn't put up with a MENSA meeting just now. Perhaps they would explain how they would've done things quicker, or how your journey was not particularly relevant or character-developing or literary enough. Sheesh.
Even if they wouldn't, well, the Means Manse is for you and you alone. You earned it.
#mistake test for sex it
>sex it
You're not even up for THAT, now. You just want to BE.

>exist
#notana
