You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start acting up then, anyway.
#nudge for masll
>masll
You'll need to pick out a store to work with. Mall or Malls is too unspecific. Also, changing Mall A to a Llama or whichever doesn't work--it's store X.

The badge just has general information. It's not useful on its own.
#nudge for flier
>flire
The flier's just there to tell you if you're done or not.

Tan Mage Nat Egam cannot help you now.

So 'dept.

#mistake test for strobe
>strobe
You're briefly assaulted by the colors of every single colored Starburst and Skittles you remember chewing. You suspect Store B may have better refreshment to add.
#mistake test for tories
>tories
I don't think they would help Yorpwald. Maybe it would help our world fractionally if they left, but I don't want to get too far into politics, here.
#mistake test for towers
>towers
That should work--but it doesn't! Maybe the towers would be too big to tackle in the game in a series, anyway.[fake-clue of store w]
#mistake test for troves
>troves
Nice try, but that's next game! You do not need riches to beat Red Bull Burdell.[fake-clue of store v]

@nud
#nudge for marquee
>marquee
You don't need to change the marquee, but maybe it'd be fun to see what's inside.

@nud
#renudge for marquee

You don't need to change the marquee now that you figured what it means.

The lodge is as good as it can be. Better ENTER it.
