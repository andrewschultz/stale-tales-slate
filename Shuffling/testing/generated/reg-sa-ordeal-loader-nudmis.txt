#testcase-mistake-shuffling-laredo
>laredo
If you want a Western game situated on the US/Mexico border, this isn't for you.

#testcase-table-of-ordeal-loader-nudges-ordeal
>ordela
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.

#testcase-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-oafs
>oasf
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.

#testcase-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-oaf
>ofa
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-magnet
>magnet
Your magenta nametag is on securely enough. Not that you actually like having it on, but you'd get scolded for not having it.

>a magnet
You never need to use the article "a" when changing things up. In particular, "a magnet" is a good guess, but it's not what the nametag ultimately needs to be. Allowing a leading article might make puzzles potentially trickier, with two word jumbles to consider instead of one.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-afos
>afos
You hum "And I Ran" to yourself, wishing you had somewhere to run, to get away.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-faso
>faso
There are even further-away places to explore in this game than Burkina Faso.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-salt-mine-saltmine
>salt mine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?

>saltmine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?

>x passage
It seems to say OPEN a bunch of times in a row. That means it is open, not that you should try to. But if you blink a bit, the OPENs run together and say NOPE. Hmm.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-peon
NOPE
>peon
You take a passive-aggressive stab at the person, now gone, who mocked you when you examined the passage. It felt good.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-pone
>pone
The meals here are much more highfalutin' than that!

#testcase-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-eopn
>eopn
The passage looks unblocked already, so you don't need to look for any other possibilities.

#general stuff
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-use-text
>use zozimus
Use is a bit too general for this game's parser to understand. You can SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-turn-text

You can probably just SWITCH something with two text settings.

A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
