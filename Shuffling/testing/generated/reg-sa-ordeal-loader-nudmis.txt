#mistake test for laredo
>laredo
If you want a Western game situated on the US/Mexico border, this isn't for you.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-nudges-ordeal
>ordela
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-oafs
>oasf
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-oaf
>ofa
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.
#mistake test for magnet
>magnet
Your magenta nametag is on securely enough. Not that you actually like having it on, but you'd get scolded for not having it.
>a magnet
You never need to use the article "a" when changing things up. In particular, "a magnet" is a good guess, but it's not what the nametag ultimately needs to be. Allowing a leading article might make puzzles potentially trickier, with two word jumbles to consider instead of one.
#mistake test for afos
>afos
You hum "And I Ran" to yourself, wishing you had somewhere to run, to get away.
#mistake test for faso
>faso
There are even further-away places to explore in this game than Burkina Faso.
#mistake test for salt mine/saltmine
>salt mine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?
>saltmine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?

#general stuff
#mistake test for use [text]
>use zozimus
Use is a bit too general for this game's parser to understand. You can SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.
#mistake test for turn [text]
>turn zozimus
You can probably just SWITCH something with two text settings.
# stuff to test before you get settler

#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-busiest
>busiets
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-noentry
>noentyr
You notice the NO ENTRY sign is misspelled, and you wonder what else--eh, nothing. Still, it might be fun to enter...
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-slim
>slmi
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-neat
>neta
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-name

#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-elevator
>elevatro
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-terraces
>terracse
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-terrace
>terraec

#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-caveat
>acevta
Vandalizing the vacate caveat is probably more trouble than it's worth.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-banner
>bannre
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.

Rested Desert

#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-rested
>restde
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. You'll find a hint device for that soon enough.
#mistake test for deters
>deters
No! You're trying to make progress here.

#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-breeze
>breeez
You try to think of it that way, but--nope, it's an odor. Not a very complex one, but an odor.
#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-smlel
>smlle
You try to think of it that way, but--nope, it's an odor. Not a very complex one, but an odor.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-odor
>doro
The odor doesn't seem too complex. You pause. You can figure what it should be.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the odor. Keep at it.

#mistake test for or do door
>rood
This game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

>door
by one point

>score
You currently have 1 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 4, and the maximum is 8

#mistake retest for or do door
>rood
You already changed the odor, and this game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-or-do-door
>doro
The door is probably the way out. Best not change it into something else.

#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-musical
>musicla
It's a pretty complex chord.

#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-chord
>chodr
It's a pretty complex chord.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-bulge
>bugel
The bulge swells and makes a squeal, like it's trying to make music.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bulge. Keep at it.

>bugle
Your score has just gone up by one point.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-bugle
>bugel
The bugle emits a sad "don't change me back" noise.
#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-horn
>honr
No, the bugle is a bugle, not just a horn. It's been changed enough.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-bolt
>blto
You think back to a combination lock you had with, well, forty cubed possibilities. Only, hmm--twenty-four, here.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bolt. Keep at it.

>blot
by one point

>score
You currently have 3 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 5, and the maximum is 8

Thickest Thickets

#mistake test for erde
>erde
There's enough earth around here, and this game's not in German.

#mistake test for rede
>rede
You probably don't want medieval-style advice. You don't need it. HINT should work better.

#ttc-table-of-thickest-thickets-nudges-thickets
>thicktes
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.

#ttc-table-of-thickest-thickets-nudges-thicket
>thickte
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside

#mistake test for ent/ents
>ent
While ents are definitely organic, they wouldn't feel quite natural here. Something else, though, maybe. Plus, that's a big thing to summon when you're still getting your powers.

#ttc-table-of-thickest-thickets-nudges-net
>nte
There's something you can do with all the nets, if you think about it.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-sent-nets
>etns
The sent nets rustle slightly.

>nest
by one point

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-nest
>ntse
The nest just looks right here, now that you summoned it.

#mistake retest for ent/ents
>ent
That's a bit too magical for here and now. The nest is nice enough.
>ents
That's a bit too magical for here and now. The nest is nice enough.

#ttc-table-of-thickest-thickets-nudges-shrub
>shrbu
The shrub and brush waver, then point towards the toga.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-reed
>eder
The reed blows in an unseen breeze.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-toga
>gota
The toga blows in an unseen breeze, exposing what's written on it a bit more.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the toga. Keep at it.
#readables for toga
>read toga
A GOT-TA GO ... hmm, not the very best ever.

#mistake test for believe
>believe
Yes, but what do you believe you can do or change?
#mistake test for gato
>gato
Nice try, but wrong language. Another animal would be more likely to eat through the thickets.

>goat
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>deer
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 6 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 7, and the maximum is 8

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-deer
>rdee
The deer is very peaceful. You dere-n't disturb it.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-goat
>gota
The goat is happy as-is. No need to go tag a ...

#renudge for shrub
>shrbu
The remains of the shrub and brush waver, then point towards the opening in the thickets.

Notices Section

>score
You currently have 6 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 7, and the maximum is 8

#readables for gateway
>read gateway
"E. g., man, TA!" is written in red, beneath the WARMUP/UM, WARP text.
Maybe it's significant that the writing's red, and that can help you
There's also a helpful ENTERING TOO SOON WILL NOT KILL YOU message, which is nice
>read board

>read board
Canny Nancy
>enter gateway
mega-ant

The red text is just like A TAN GEM and such on the broad board
!There's also a helpful ENTERING TOO SOON WILL NOT KILL YOU message, which is nice

#mistake test for mist
>mist
No, those TMIs on the broad board are useful.
#mistake test for noetics
>noetics
There's enough information here.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-notices
>noticse
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. There's a hint device here that'll help, then.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-static
>attisc
You think a bit, and the static seems like a bad extension to the doll house.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the static. Keep at it.

>score
You currently have 6 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 7, and the maximum is 8

>attics
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 7 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You have found all the secret points in the region, so you will get the maximum score once you solve it.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-attics
>attisc
Hm, you can't think of anything to do with the attics but change them back.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the attics. Keep at it.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-doll
>dlol
The attics shake slightly.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-house
>houes
The attics shake slightly.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-gateway
>gatewya
Nothing changes. Maybe you just need to walk through it, if and when you're prepared.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-borda
>borad
The broad board is just there to read.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-tmis
>tims
The TMIs are there to help you.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-tmi
>tim
The TMIs are there to help you.

>newladn
You will have to change the new land one item at a time.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-nametag
>gatemna
The nametag peels infinitesimally.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the magenta nametag. Keep at it.

#mistake test for get a man
>get a man
Very good. Very close. But here's a meta-nag: what kind of man? What would he work with?

>gateman
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 8 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions and get the tagged gadget, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

#mistake retest for get a man
>get a man
"Gateman, get a man, very clever. But thing is, you'll be working with things, not ideas or actions."

#mistake test for almond
>almond
"Don't try anything too nutty!" booms Nat Egam.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-gateman
>gatemna
Don't scramble the gateman. He's here to help.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-warpy
>waryp
You can't change Old Warpy. You have to just trust it.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-old
>odl
You can't change Old Warpy. You have to just trust it.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-oldman
>oldmna
He's too old to change. At least, in his present form.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-dollhouse
>dollhoues
Thinking that doesn't do much, but the attics seem to glow a bit.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-attic
>attci
You feel nothing from either attic. Perhaps you need to consider both the attics--though really, you don't see why you'd want to bring the static back.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-warmup
>warmpu
You can't change what's in the gateway. You just have to trust whatever is(n't) in there won't harm you.

>take gadget
As you pick it up, you see it's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
Nat Egam nods. "Take good care of it. Well, it's hard to break, so don't feel you'll wear it out. I'm proud of what I can make it do ... and  yet ... I have some ideas for a new version, maybe far in the future, if worse evil comes to Yorpwald. Anyhoo."

>score
You currently have 8 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

>ask gateman about cabinet

#mistake test for remove [something] from [something]
>remove phial from cabinet
To keep things simple for you (and, okay, for my coding efforts,) I recommend TAKE X instead of REMOVE/FROM. REMOVE defaults to carried or worn items, and I'm too lazy to tweak that.

#mistake test for angel
>angel
You've got enough practical help. You don't need anything supernatural.

#mistake test for beatnic
>beatnic
The cabinet deserves a better fate than THAT.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-acne-bit-cabinet
>cbitean
The cabinet wobbles a bit.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the acne-bit cabinet. Keep at it.

You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start constantly giving readings then, anyway.
