#mistake test for laredo
>laredo
If you want a Western game situated on the US/Mexico border, this isn't for you.

#nudge for ordeal
>ordela
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#nudge for oafs
>oasf
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.
#nudge for oaf
>ofa
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.
#mistake test for magnet
>magnet
Your magenta nametag is on securely enough. Not that you actually like having it on, but you'd get scolded for not having it.
>a magnet
You never need to use the article "a" when changing things up. In particular, "a magnet" is a good guess, but it's not what the nametag ultimately needs to be. Allowing a leading article might make puzzles potentially trickier, with two word jumbles to consider instead of one.
#mistake test for afos
>afos
You hum "And I Ran" to yourself, wishing you had somewhere to run, to get away.
#mistake test for faso
>faso
There are even further-away places to explore in this game than Burkina Faso.
#mistake test for salt mine/saltmine
>salt mine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?
>saltmine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?

#general stuff
#mistake test for use [text]
>use zozimus
Use is a bit too general for this game's parser to understand. You can SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.
#mistake test for turn [text]
>turn zozimus
You can probably just SWITCH something with two text settings.
# stuff to test before you get settler

>cr xyz
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a list of common verbs, type VERBS.
#mistake test for rc
>rc
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a list of common verbs, type VERBS.
#mistake test for rc [text]
>rc xyz
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a list of common verbs, type VERBS.

#nudge for busiest
>busiets
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.
#nudge for noentry
>noentyr
You notice the NO ENTRY sign is misspelled, and you wonder what else--eh, nothing. Still, it might be fun to enter...
#nudge for slim
>slmi
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#nudge for neat
>neta
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#nudge for name
>naem
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#nudge for list
>lits
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.
#nudge for elevator
>elevatro
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
#nudge for terraces
>terracse
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
#nudge for terrace
>terraec
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.
#nudge for caveat
>acevta
Vandalizing the vacate caveat is probably more trouble than it's worth.
#nudge for banner
>bannre
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.

Rested Desert

#nudge for rested
>restde
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. You'll find a hint device for that soon enough.
#mistake test for deters
>deters
No! You're trying to make progress here.

#nudge for breeze
>breeez
You try to think of it that way, but--nope, it's an odor. Not a very complex one, but an odor.
#nudge for smlel
>smlle
You try to think of it that way, but--nope, it's an odor. Not a very complex one, but an odor.

#spechelp for odor
>doro
The odor doesn't seem too complex. You pause. You can figure what it should be.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the odor. Keep at it.

#mistake test for or do door
>rood
This game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

>door
by one point

>score
You currently have 1 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 4, and the maximum is 7

#mistake retest for or do door
>rood
You already changed the odor, and this game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

#done rejects for OR DO door
>doro
The door is probably the way out. Best not change it into something else.

#nudge for musical
>musicla
It's a pretty complex chord.

#nudge for chord
>chodr
It's a pretty complex chord.

#spechelp for bulge
>bugel
The bulge swells and makes a squeal, like it's trying to make music.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bulge. Keep at it.

>bugle
Your score has just gone up by one point.

#done rejects for bugle
>bugel
The bugle emits a sad "don't change me back" noise.
#nudge for horn
>honr
No, the bugle is a bugle, not just a horn. It's been changed enough.

#spechelp for bolt
>blto
You think back to a combination lock you had with, well, forty cubed possibilities. Only, hmm--twenty-four, here.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bolt. Keep at it.

>blot
by one point

>score
You currently have 3 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 5, and the maximum is 7

>open door
Thickest Thickets

#nudge for thickets
>thicktes
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.

#nudge for thicket
>thickte
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside

#nudge for darnel
>darnle
If it were just one darnel, there'd be no point in getting mad. But there are a bunch.

#nudge for darnels
>darnesl
You might be able to clear the darnels a bit, but they're not as thick as, well, the thicket.

#mistake test for landers
>landers
There will be better hints than a manners advice column once you move on, though the darnels make you see red for a bit.
#mistake test for sandler
>sandler
I award you zero points for that anagramming try, and may God have mercy on your soul. Okay, actually, you're close to one point.

>slander
by one point

#mistake retest for landers
>landers
There will be better hints than a manners advice column once you move on.
#mistake retest for sandler
>sandler
I award you zero points for that anagramming try, and may God have mercy on your soul for trying to sneak another point.

#renudge for darnel
>darnle
You already got mad at all the darnels. You need to move on

#renudge for darnels
>darnesl
You already messed with the darnels.

#nudge for shrub
>shrbu
The shrub and brush waver, then point towards the toga.

#spechelp for toga
>gota
The toga blows in an unseen breeze, exposing what's written on it a bit more.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the toga. Keep at it.
#readables for toga
>read toga
A GOT-TA GO ... hmm, not the very best ever.

#mistake test for believe
>believe
Yes, but what do you believe you can do or change?
#mistake test for gato
>gato
Nice try, but wrong language. Another animal would be more likely to eat through the thickets.

>goat
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 5 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 6, and the maximum is 7

#renudge for shrub
>shrbu
The remains of the shrub and brush waver, then point towards the opening in the thickets.

Notices Section

#readables for gateway
>read gateway
"E. g., man, TA!" is written in red, beneath the WARMUP/UM, WARP text.
Maybe it's significant that the writing's red, and that can help you
There's also a helpful ENTERING TOO SOON WILL NOT KILL YOU message, which is nice
>read board
OUR NEEDS ENDURE SO!
>read board
Canny Nancy
>enter gateway
mega-ant
>read gateway
The red text is just like A TAN GEM and such on the broad board
!There's also a helpful ENTERING TOO SOON WILL NOT KILL YOU message, which is nice

#mistake test for mist
>mist
No, those TMIs on the broad board are useful.
#mistake test for noetics
>noetics
There's enough information here.

#nudge for notices
>noticse
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. There's a hint device here that'll help, then.

#spechelp for static
>attisc
You think a bit, and the static seems like a bad extension to the doll house.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the static. Keep at it.

>score
You currently have 5 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 6, and the maximum is 7

>attics
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 6 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You have found all the secret points in the region, so you will get the maximum score once you solve it.

#spechelp for attics
>attisc
Hm, you can't think of anything to do with the attics but change them back.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the attics. Keep at it.

#nudge for doll
>dlol
The attics shake slightly.

#nudge for house
>houes
The attics shake slightly.

#nudge for gateway
>gatewya
Nothing changes. Maybe you just need to walk through it, if and when you're prepared.

#nudge for borda
>borad
The broad board is just there to read.

#nudge for tmis
>tims
The TMIs are there to help you.

#nudge for tmi
>tim
The TMIs are there to help you.

#nudge for newland
>newladn
You will have to change the new land one item at a time.

#spechelp for nametag
>gatemna
The nametag peels infinitesimally.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the magenta nametag. Keep at it.

#mistake test for get a man
>get a man
Very good. Very close. But here's a meta-nag: what kind of man? What would he work with?

>gateman
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 7 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions and get the tagged gadget, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

#mistake retest for get a man
>get a man
"Gateman, get a man, very clever. But thing is, you'll be working with things, not ideas or actions."

#mistake test for almond
>almond
"Don't try anything too nutty!" booms Nat Egam.

#done rejects for gateman
>gatemna
Don't scramble the gateman. He's here to help.
#nudge for warpy
>waryp
You can't change Old Warpy. You have to just trust it.
#nudge for old
>odl
You can't change Old Warpy. You have to just trust it.
#nudge for oldman
>oldmna
He's too old to change. At least, in his present form.
#nudge for dollhouse
>dollhoues
Thinking that doesn't do much, but the attics seem to glow a bit.
#nudge for attic
>attci
You feel nothing from either attic. Perhaps you need to consider both the attics--though really, you don't see why you'd want to bring the static back.
#nudge for warmup
>warmpu
You can't change what's in the gateway. You just have to trust whatever is(n't) in there won't harm you.

>take gadget
As you pick it up, you see it's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
Nat Egam nods. "Take good care of it. Well, it's hard to break, so don't feel you'll wear it out. I'm proud of what I can make it do ... and  yet ... I have some ideas for a new version, maybe far in the future, if worse evil comes to Yorpwald. Anyhoo."

>score
You currently have 7 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

>ask gateman about cabinet

#mistake test for remove [something] from [something]
>remove phial from cabinet
To keep things simple for you (and, okay, for my coding efforts,) I recommend TAKE X instead of REMOVE/FROM. REMOVE defaults to carried or worn items, and I'm too lazy to tweak that.

#mistake test for angel
>angel
You've got enough practical help. You don't need anything supernatural.

#mistake test for beatnic
>beatnic
The cabinet deserves a better fate than THAT.

#spechelp for acne bit cabinet
>cbitean
The cabinet wobbles a bit.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the acne-bit cabinet. Keep at it.
#readables for acne bit cabinet
>read cabinet
Here is one of several writings in red in the cabinet:
/(I C BEATN\.|IN, BE, ACT!!!|C N-E BAIT??|CIT-E BAN!!!|Numbers for a NITECAB\.|ABE 'N TIC!|TEN ABC, I!!!)

#renudge for notices
>noticse
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start constantly giving readings then, anyway.
