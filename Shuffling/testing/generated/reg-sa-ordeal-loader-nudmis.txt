#testcase-mistake-shuffling-laredo
>laredo
If you want a Western game situated on the US/Mexico border, this isn't for you.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-nudges-ordeal
>ordela
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-oafs
>oasf
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-oaf
>ofa
The Oafs' Sofa is there, and there's nothing you can do about it.
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-magnet
>magnet
Your magenta nametag is on securely enough. Not that you actually like having it on, but you'd get scolded for not having it.
>a magnet
You never need to use the article "a" when changing things up. In particular, "a magnet" is a good guess, but it's not what the nametag ultimately needs to be. Allowing a leading article might make puzzles potentially trickier, with two word jumbles to consider instead of one.
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-afos
>afos
You hum "And I Ran" to yourself, wishing you had somewhere to run, to get away.
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-faso
>faso
There are even further-away places to explore in this game than Burkina Faso.
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-salt-mine-saltmine
>salt mine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?
>saltmine
Oh, a new job wouldn't be THAT dreary. But what if there is something else?

>x passage
It seems to say OPEN a bunch of times in a row. That means it is open, not that you should try to. But if you blink a bit, the OPENs run together and say NOPE. Hmm.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-peon
NOPE
>peon
You take a passive-aggressive stab at the person, now gone, who mocked you when you examined the passage. It felt good.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-pone
>pone
The meals here are much more highfalutin' than that!

#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-eopn
>eopn
The passage looks unblocked already, so you don't need to look for any other possibilities.

#general stuff
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-use-text
>use zozimus
Use is a bit too general for this game's parser to understand. You can SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-turn-text
>turn zozimus
You can probably just SWITCH something with two text settings.

#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-busiest
>busiets
You may need to change a room later, but you'll have a hint device to do so.
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-noentry
>noentyr
You notice the NO ENTRY sign is misspelled, and you wonder what else--eh, nothing. Still, it might be fun to enter...
#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-slim
>slmi
You could get in trouble for mucking with a list of potential job competitors. You're not sure if you're ready for a new job, yet.

#ttc-table-of-busiest-subsite-nudges-elevator
>elevatro
A voice in your head tells you that sort of mental wandering is what got you canned in the first place. Maybe it'd disappear if you could somehow, well, leave.

/^Rested Desert

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-bruhs
>bruhs
No, you don't need to mix up the shrub and brush. That's not where you'll find passage out.

#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-rested
>restde
You may need to change a room later, but you'll have a hint device to do so.
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-deters
>deters
No! You're trying to make progress here.

#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-breeze
>breeez
You try to think of it that way, but--nope, it's an odor. Not a very complex one, but an odor.
#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-smlel
>smlle
You try to think of it that way, but--nope, it's an odor. Not a very complex one, but an odor.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-odor
>doro
The odor doesn't seem too complex. You pause. You can figure what it should be.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the odor. Keep at it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-rood
>rood
This game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

>door
by one point

>score
You currently have 1 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 4, and the maximum is 8

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-bruhs
>bruhs
No, you don't need to mix up the shrub and brush. The door seems a more likely candidate.

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-rood
>rood
You already changed the odor, and this game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-or-do-door
>doro
The door is probably the way out. Best not change it into something else.

#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-musical
>musicla
It's a pretty complex chord.

#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-chord
>chodr
It's a pretty complex chord.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-bulge
>bugel
The bulge swells and makes a squeal, like it's trying to make music.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bulge. Keep at it.

>bugle
Your score has just gone up by one point.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-bugle
>bugel
The bugle emits a sad "don't change me back" noise.
#ttc-table-of-rested-desert-nudges-horn
>honr
No, the bugle is a bugle, not just a horn. It's been changed enough.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-bolt
>blto
You think back to a combination lock you had with, well, forty cubed possibilities. Only, hmm--twenty-four, here.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bolt. Keep at it.

/^Thickest Thickets

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-erde
>erde
There's enough earth around here, and this game's not in German.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-rede
>rede
You probably don't want medieval-style advice. You don't need it. HINT should work better.

#ttc-table-of-thickest-thickets-nudges-thickets
>thicktes
You may need to change a room later, but you'll have a hint device to do so.

#ttc-table-of-thickest-thickets-nudges-thicket
>thickte
You may need to change a room later, but you'll have a hint device to do so.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-ent-ents
>ent
While ents are definitely organic, they wouldn't feel quite natural here. Something else, though, maybe. Plus, that's a big thing to summon when you're still getting your powers.

#ttc-table-of-thickest-thickets-nudges-net

There's something you can do with all the nets, if you think about it.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-sent-nets
>etns
The sent nets rustle slightly.

>nest

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-nest

The nest just looks right here, now that you summoned it.

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-ent-ents

That's a bit too magical for here and now. The nest is nice enough.

#ttc-table-of-thickest-thickets-nudges-shrub
>shrbu
The shrub and brush waver, then point towards the toga.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-reed
>eder
The reed blows in an unseen breeze.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-toga
>gota
The toga blows in an unseen breeze, exposing what's written on it a bit more.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the toga. Keep at it.
#ttc-table-of-readables-toga
>read toga
A GOT-TA GO ... hmm, not the very best ever.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-believe
>believe
Yes, but what do you believe you can do or change?
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-gato
>gato
Nice try, but wrong language. Another animal would be more likely to eat through the thickets.

>goat
Your score has just gone up by one point.

You currently have 6 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 7, and the maximum is 8

#ttc-table-of-readables-gateway
>read gateway
"E. g., man, TA!" is written in red, beneath the WARMUP/UM, WARP text.
Maybe it's significant that the writing's red, and that can help you
There's also a helpful ENTERING TOO SOON WILL NOT KILL YOU message, which is nice
>read board

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-mist
>mist
No, those TMIs on the broad board are useful.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-noetics
>noetics
There's enough information here.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-tastic
>tastic
Are you saying this game is only two-thirds fantastic so far? Oh, I guess that's nice enough.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-notices
>noticse
You don't need to change this place, though the cabinet holds a hint device to tell you when to act on your location.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-static
>attisc
You think a bit, and the static seems like a bad extension to the doll house.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the static. Keep at it.

>score
You currently have 6 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 7, and the maximum is 8

>attics
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 7 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You have found all the secret points in the region, so you will get the maximum score once you solve it.

Are you saying this game is only two-thirds fantastic so far? Oh, I guess that's nice enough.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-attics
>attisc
Hm, you can't think of anything to do with the attics but change them back.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the attics. Keep at it.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-doll
>dlol
The attics shake slightly.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-house
>houes
The attics shake slightly.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-gateway
>gatewya
Nothing changes. Maybe you just need to walk through it, if and when you're prepared.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-borda
>borad
The broad board is just there to read.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-tmis

The TMIs are there to help you.

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-tmi

#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-newland

You will have to change the new land one item at a time.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-spechelp-nametag
>gatemna
The nametag peels infinitesimally.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the magenta nametag. Keep at it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-get-a-man
>get a man
Very good. Very close. But here's a meta-nag: what kind of man? What would he work with?

>gateman
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 8 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions and get the tagged gadget, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-get-a-man
>get a man
"Gateman, get a man, very clever. But thing is, you'll be working with things, not ideas or actions."

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-almond
>almond
"Don't try anything too nutty!" booms Nat Egam.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-done-rejects-gateman
>gatemna
Don't scramble the gateman. He's here to help.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-warpy
>waryp
You can't change Old Warpy. You have to just trust it.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-old
>odl
You can't change Old Warpy. You have to just trust it.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-oldman
>oldmna
He's too old to change. At least, in his present form.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-dollhouse
>dollhoues
Thinking that doesn't do much, but the attics seem to glow a bit.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-attic
>attci
You feel nothing from either attic. Perhaps you need to consider both the attics--though really, you don't see why you'd want to bring the static back.
#ttc-table-of-notices-section-nudges-warmup
>warmpu
You can't change what's in the gateway. You just have to trust whatever is(n't) in there won't harm you.

>take gadget
As you pick it up, you see it's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
Nat Egam nods. "Take good care of it. Well, it's hard to break, so don't feel you'll wear it out. I'm proud of what I can make it do ... and  yet ... I have some ideas for a new version, maybe far in the future, if worse evil comes to Yorpwald. Anyhoo."

>score
You currently have 8 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

>ask gateman about cabinet

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-remove-something-from-something
>remove phial from cabinet
To keep things simple for you (and, okay, for my coding efforts,) I recommend TAKE X instead of REMOVE/FROM. REMOVE defaults to carried or worn items, and I'm too lazy to tweak that.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-angel

You've got enough practical help. You don't need anything supernatural.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-beatnic

The cabinet deserves a better fate than THAT.
