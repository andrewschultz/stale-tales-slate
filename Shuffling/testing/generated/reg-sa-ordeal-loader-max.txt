That way's an hour or two of listening to an under-action denunciator. You sure?
You sort of procrastinate the lecture, thinking it'd be fun to just ditch.
For all the lectures about new and exciting possibilities everyone should know about, you'd like one for your own.

That way's a costlier cloister of rooms than recent firees deserve. The measure-a-resume event will be there, but not for another couple hours. You don't really want to deal with agents or headhunters now, anyway, but the name list catches your eye.
Your eye catches the side passage, which looks more interesting than the standard ways out. Maybe you could give it a look.

You already spent too much time in the overlate elevator.
You feel sort of cornered by all the main passages. Sneaking off anywhere would be kind of fun.

The Caterers' Terraces are west. You see someone sweating over a bizarre brazier, hear how this next lecture will "Prep us for supper," and promptly lose your will to do anything for a minute.
The standard, usual directions don't seem to cut it. But there has to be somewhere else.

The nametag seems to try to rip itself from your clothes for a moment, but it settles back down. Maybe the time isn't right.
(That's worth noting in your notepad for later, so you do, under FLIPS.)

It's shaped like a narrow rectangle with rounded corners. Very unnatural! There's no way to pry or pull it from the door, given its shape. You give it a few taps, but it's wedged in.

It seems to hold the OR DO door in place.

The gateman looks over to the mega ant and does some weird hand-fu. The ant scampers off. "There. Should be able to walk in now. I mean, after you ask me for all the help you want."
The gateman pauses again, then asks if you had that bugle. It's something he'd been meaning to take up, but he wanted to give you more than one way to get here. You explain you lost it rolling down a hill to get here.
"No worries. I'll get it when you're gone. You probably won't want to be around when I start practising, anyway. This time, I will. Being a nametag for a bit--or just replaced by one--gives a fellow motivation to do those things he's put off."

"Hey, that's a good idea," says the gateman. "The cabinet's still recovering from its wounds back when Red Bull Burdell almost destroyed it. But it'll be seeing you again. When it does, I think Bactine will work." He pauses. "Oh. There probably won't be many brand names like that to worry about, unless they're even more ubiquitous. Like, say, Xerox."
(That's worth noting in your notepad for later, so you do, once again, under FLIPS.)

>take gadget
As you pick it up, you see it's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
Nat Egam nods. "Take good care of it. Well, it's hard to break, so don't feel you'll wear it out. I'm proud of what I can make it do ... and  yet ... I have some ideas for a new version, maybe far in the future, if worse evil comes to Yorpwald. Anyhoo."
