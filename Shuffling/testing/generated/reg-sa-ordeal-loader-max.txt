#pre-nametag-gateman rule
>gateman
The nametag seems to try to rip itself from your clothes for a moment, but it settles back down. Maybe the time isn't right.
[That's worth noting in your notepad for later, so you do, under FLIPS.]

>play bugle
The note from the bugle causes the door to swing back and forth, even with the bolt in place. You can probably enter now.

Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 8 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions and get the tagged gadget, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

>take gadget
As you pick it up, you see it's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
Nat Egam nods. "Take good care of it. Well, it's hard to break, so don't feel you'll wear it out. I'm proud of what I can make it do ... and  yet ... I have some ideas for a new version, maybe far in the future, if worse evil comes to Yorpwald. Anyhoo."

>ask gateman about cabinet

#pre-cabinet-bactine rule
>bactine
"Hey, that's a good idea," says the gateman. "The cabinet's still recovering from its wounds back when Red Bull Burdell almost destroyed it. But it'll be seeing you again. When it does, I think Bactine will work." He pauses. "Oh. There probably won't be many brand names like that to worry about, unless they're even more ubiquitous. Like, say, Xerox."
