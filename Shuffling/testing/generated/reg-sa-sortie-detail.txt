/^Trap Part

#gadget test: exitsne to sixteen
>rc dial
The gadget, when over the EXITS part, reads RRRRR ? ?--flipping between RR and GG. The dial's solution probably has the letters EXITS in it, somehow.
The gadget, when over the EXITS part, reads BBBBG ? ?--flipping reds and blues. The dial's solution probably has the letters EXITS in it, somehow.

>sixteen
#notana -- technically, it is, but it's handled through the dial code, so it could be a number. This is an odd one, but there you go.
