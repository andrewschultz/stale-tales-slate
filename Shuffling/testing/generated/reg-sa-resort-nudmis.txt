You already made passage to the ogled lodge. It's good enough. Why change it?

Astral Altars

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-lites
>lites
Light isn't the problem here. It's not having anywhere to go.
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-slite
>slite
That's bad spelling, and it won't shrink your problems.

#ttc-table-of-astral-altars-nudges-astral
>astrla
While there doesn't seem to be much to do here, you don't need to do anything to the location name. The stile and tiles may be more useful.
#ttc-table-of-astral-altars-nudges-altar
>altra
While there doesn't seem to be much to do here, you don't need to do anything to the location name. The stile and tiles may be more useful.
#ttc-table-of-resort-nudges-resort
>resotr
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-islet
>tilse
The tiles rattle as if to shift but settle down.
#ttc-table-of-astral-altars-nudges-tile
>tiel
You need to deal with all the tiles.
#ttc-table-of-astral-altars-nudges-flare
>s
>flaer
The feral flare crackles menacingly. You doubt you can change it for the better.
#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-tiles
>islte
The tiles rattle as if to shift but settle down.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the tiles. Keep at it.
#ttc-table-of-readables-tiles
>read tiles
The tiles blur a bit as you (de)-focus just right. You see subtleties in the blues and brown that seem to spell out LEST I. But with the effort, your eyes water, and you see red a bit.
#renudge for altar
>altra
While you're sort of trapped here, you don't need to do anything to the location name. The stile and tiles may be more useful.

>islet
Your score has just gone up by one point.

Leis Isle

>score
You currently have 1 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 10, and the maximum is 15

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-download
>download
The woodland appears to glitch in and out like a loaded JPEG. It doesn't seem fully real
!But then, since the leis were fake, you shouldn't be surprised the woodland is, too.
>download
You wait for the woodland to download fully, but it doesn't. Well, maybe that's what you get for playing a text adventure.
>lies
>download
But then, since the leis were fake, you shouldn't be surprised the woodland is, too.
>undo

#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-woodland
>wooldand
The woodland can't be the way out. The isle is too small. There's enough outside the woodland to look at, anyway.

#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-and
>adn
The sand and sands and sands are just--well, sand. They won't help you get off the island.

#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-sands
>sansd
The sand and sands and sands are just--well, sand. They won't help you get off the island.
#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-l2
>lesi
You feel about to reveal an uncomfortable untruth, yet you also feel a bit of relief.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the leis. Keep at it.

#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-lie
>eil
Perhaps you can deal with the leis, or maybe you can use something else to escape the isle.

#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-sand
>sadn
The sand and sands and sands are just--well, sand. They won't help you get off the island.

#renudge for islet
>tilse
That's how you got here, twiddling items in the Astral Altars. But you have new things to play with so you can leave.

#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-eter
>eter
The tree sits there, but the swing rocks a bit.

#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-oflat
>aftol
You notice writing on the rock and swing similar to what you just said. Or tried to say. Also, no need to make anything lo-fat here.

#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-rock
>crko
Hmm, a rock, but only so much you can do with it.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the rock. Keep at it.

>lies
by one point
>score
You currently have 2 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 11, and the maximum is 15

#note that there is no renudge for leis because before L2 is moot, we go to the table of spechelp. But for lei, we are always in the table of nudges.
#ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-leis
>isel
You already noticed the leis. Use something on the isle to escape it.
#+ttc-table-of-leis-isle-nudges-lie
>iel
You already noticed the leis. Use something on the isle to escape it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-lies-lie

You reflect on how insidious it was to stick you here in a false paradise.

You currently have 3 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 11, and the maximum is 15

#ttc-table-of-resort-done-rejects-cork
>crko
Your head swims then sinks as you realize the cork can't become much else.

#renudge for oflat
>aftol
You have a way off this island to the east, though you can make the other for fun, too. Also, no need to make anything lo-fat here.

#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-swing
>winsg
The swing goes slightly airborne.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the swing. Keep at it.

>wings
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>score
You currently have 4 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 12, and the maximum is 15

#ttc-table-of-resort-done-rejects-wings
>winsg
The wings should be able to propel you enough.

#renudge for oflat
>aftol
You can just use either the cork or the wings to leave to the east.

#renudge for eter
>eter
The tree sits there.

>e
Rived Drive

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-repos
>repos
You resolve to organize your programming code better once this adventure is over.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-verdi
>verdi
You don't need a musical score for this adventure.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-diver
>diver
But you just got by a lot of water. No need to go back in.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-blow
>blwo
You don't need to make any blow bowl more chaotic.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-drive
>driev
There is too much lying around here to mess with the Rived Drive's name.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-tool
>loto
Hm, no, the whole tool shed.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-shed
>shde
Hm, no, the whole tool shed.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-ashed
>asdeh
A shed may provide shade, but you need a way up.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-window
>windwo
They remain still. Maybe the toolshed itself.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-windows
>windwos
They remain still. Maybe the toolshed itself.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-ulock
>ulokc
Nope. That lock's secure.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-lock
>lokc
Nope. That lock's secure.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-pole
>pelo
Only changing one pole would still leave a vertical barrier.

#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-poles
>polse
The poles start to bend at an angle--or maybe that's the light.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the poles. Keep at it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-prose
>prose
There's not much of that left in this game, and more of it won't help you up the poles. The spore can be something sturdier. You see red wondering what.

>slope
by one point

>score
You currently have 5 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 12, and the maximum is 15

#ttc-table-of-resort-done-rejects-slope
>pelso
You wouldn't want to make the slope crumble away.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-loot
>loot
You don't have time for treasure with Red Bull Burdell waiting.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-pores
>pores
Almost. But you don't need to create holes.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-poser
>poser
You wonder if YOU are the poser, for not being able to figure what to do.

#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-tool-shed
>toeholsd
You hear an unseen hinge neigh as if in defiance. You may be getting somewhere, here.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the tool shed. Keep at it.
#ttc-table-of-readables-u-lock
>read u lock
Red writing shows the U-Lock brand is OLD THOSE.

>toeholds
Your score has just gone up by two points.

You currently have 7 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 12, and the maximum is 15

#ttc-table-of-resort-done-rejects-toeholds
>toeholsd
The toeholds could be handy for getting up and out of here.

#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-spore
>respo
You briefly wonder what the spore could grow into, given time. Time you don't have. Maye something circular, or something long and stringy.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the spore. Keep at it.

>ropes
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 8 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 13, and the maximum is 15

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-prose
>prose
There's not much of that left in this game, and more of it won't help you up the slope. The ropes will.

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-poser
>poser
You mutter a small epithet at where Red Bull Burdell could be. No, he's not around, but he must be near.

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-pores
>pores
No, you had it.

#ttc-table-of-resort-done-rejects-ropes
>respo
The ropes are useful for climbing, which you need to do to get east.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-rope
>repo
Those are already useful.

#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-sprig
>grisp
The sprig seems to grow less fragile for a moment.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the sprig. Keep at it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-prigs
>prigs
Grumbling about prigs, or showing those prigs, won't help now. You should probably make the sprig into something useful instead.

>grips
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 9 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 14, and the maximum is 15

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-prigs
>prigs
Grumbling about prigs, or showing those prigs, won't help now. You should probably use the grips to climb instead.

#ttc-table-of-resort-done-rejects-grips
>grisp
You can't get ahold of anything that would be more useful than the grips.

#ttc-table-of-rived-drive-nudges-grip
>pirg
Those are already useful.

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-turf
>tufr
The frust turfs are unchangeable.
#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-hotsopt
>hotspto
Placating the people here is your best bet for making this place less of a hotspot.
#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-rioters
>riotesr
Perhaps it's best to keep it simple and cut down the riot.
#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-rioter

Perhaps it's best to keep it simple and cut down the riot.
#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-people

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-clay
>clya
No, the clay is a clue to what the protest really wants to do.
#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-riot
>troi
The riot's still a crowd, and a big one, too.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the riot. Keep at it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-i-rot
>i rot
Don't give up! Perhaps there are only four or fewer rioters with their heart really in it.

>trio
Your score has just gone up by one point.

You currently have 10 out of 15 total points for the Resort region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 14, and the maximum is 15

#ttc-table-of-resort-done-rejects-protest
>troi
You can deal with three people. But you'll have to change their motivations.

#renudge for clay
>clya
No, the clay is a clue to what the trio really wants to do.

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-protesters
>ersprotest
They're just a simple protest.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-ether
>ether
They're not bad people. But even bad people don't deserve to vanish like that! Give them something constructive to do.
>kilns
by one point
>ether
They're not bad people. But even bad people don't deserve to vanish like that! Maybe they can get a purpose or become able to use those kilns.
>undo

#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-protest
>pottesr
The protesters mumble at you for trying to exert mind control. You've struck a nerve.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the trio. Keep at it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-roister
>roister
That's what's causing the riot, and it's up to you to quiet the rioters--well, the riot.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-spotter
>spotter
No, you see 'em, you just need a better way to disperse 'em.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-lacy

>pottre
Picking one person out of a crowd never works.

#ttc-table-of-resort-done-rejects-potters
>pottesr
You've changed the potters enough. Now you need to give them something interesting to do besides protest.

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-three
>ethre
The trio remains unmoved. Perhaps you can get the potters something to work with?

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-chainlinks
>chainliskn
You're overthinking it. Or you hope you are. It's both a chain, and links.

#ttc-table-of-resort-spechelp-chain-links
>ainch
The links rattle slightly. Perhaps they are chaining others' creativity as well as your own.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the chain links. Keep at it.

You don't have the ability to dish out an achin', but you see red from wanting to do so.

#notana
Your score has just gone up by one point.

You don't have the ability to dish out an achin'.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-slink
>slink
Too many people are watching for you to slink away.

#respechelp for chain links

The links rattle slightly. Perhaps they are chaining others' creativity as well as your own, and maybe the links have artsy potential beyond the china you made.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the links. Keep at it.

You don't know him that well. No riffing on his initials!

#renudge for hotsopt
>hotspto
Finding Red Bull Burdell's weakness is your best bet for making this place less of a hotspot.
#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-red
>rde
Burdell's laugh echoes. "You think you can change ME?!"

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-bull

Burdell's laugh echoes. "You think you can change ME?!"

Burdell's laugh echoes. "You think you can change ME?!"

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-boot

The boot is already a little--modified. You can see its toe. Maybe that is a weakness.

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-toe
>teo
But what to do with Red Bull Burdell's toe now that he's yelling GET OUT?

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-scar

No time for cosmetic changes.

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-crass
>crssa
No time for cosmetic changes.

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-cutlery
>cutleyr
Red Bull Burdell laughs at your puny attempt. There's no weakness in the cutlery--maybe somewhere, or something, else?

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-tshirt
>tshirt
You slur out a few consonants--maybe you should work with something closer, lower down.

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-rage

No, the rage gear is too strong.

A long-haired fellow wearing a St. Louis Cardinals t-shirt and an American flag bandana appears, holds up a sign saying GET A BRAIN, and vanishes. Whoah! That was random!

>retest
Oh, wow! Do you really want to play through again? I'm flattered!

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-romans
>romans
It's a pretty ritzy area. It doesn't need sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, or public health.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-tester
>tester
Your tester, Red Bull Burdell, is vanquished. Let's keep it that way.
On the other hand, if you're volunteering to test my other games, I could always use the help.

#renudge for hotsopt
>hotspto
You don't want to make this place a hotspot again.

#ttc-table-of-potshot-hotspot-nudges-setter

It's Setter Street now. Seems like an appropriate tribute to a hero like you.

Means Manse

#ttc-table-of-means-manse-nudges-manse

You'd like to feel more welcome in the Means Manse. There must be a way or two. You could also find a way to ignore the exits.
#ttc-table-of-means-manse-nudges-extis
>extis
That's not quite the right sort of nothing.
#ttc-table-of-means-manse-nudges-marble

No, we know who's to blame. He's done with. Time to move on.
#testcase-mistake-shuffling-mensa
>mensa
No, you couldn't put up with a MENSA meeting just now. Perhaps they would explain how they would've done things quicker, or how your journey was not particularly relevant or character-developing or literary enough. Sheesh.
Even if they wouldn't, well, the Means Manse is for you and you alone. You earned it.
