You see yourself exploring the ogled lodge you created.

Astral Altars

You watch as the tiles shrink from a large land mass to a smaller one.
>angle
You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. You notice a weird haze around the tiles for a few seconds.

#ttc-table-of-resort-anagrams-tiles
>xx stile
As your vision blurs, the stile seems to stand over a small islet.

#+ttc-table-of-resort-anagrams-tiles
>xx tiles
As your vision blurs, the tiles' blue, green and brown re-form to make an islet.

#ttc-table-of-nowheres-astral-altars
>w
As you step away from the altars, a weird barrier blocks you. It's very tarsal. Then a voice in your head booms "THE FERAL FLARE MUST PROTECT ONE LIKE YOU FROM INFIDELS!"
Unfortunately, it's also protecting you from leaving, so you'll probably need a bit more magic.
>w
No, the feral flare is pretty much any which way. Looks like you'll need to do something with the tiles and stile, instead.

>islet
Your score has just gone up by one point.

Leis Isle

You see yourself either swimming or flying east, but not without proper gear.
>angle
You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. You notice weird hazes around the leis (faint), the swing and the rock for a few seconds.
>get leis
DEBUG INFO: Taking away a max point. Max-score now 14.
The leis wither as you touch them. "I SEE ILLS!" booms an unseen voice. Yes, the leis were...LIES. Your final resort must be further on.

Some aftertaste from the saltine doesn't feel great. You wonder if this is the best way to use your vision. Use it anyway?
Your vision blurs as you recall people you thought you trusted telling you lies.

You step into the woodland and somehow bang your head! You see the word DOWNLOAD blinking in front of you. Odd, very odd.

Rived Drive

You see the poles to the east bend at an angle.
>angle
You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. You notice weird hazes around the poles, the tool shed, the spore and the sprig for a few seconds.

#ttc-table-of-nowheres-rived-drive

You'd probably get lost that way. Besides, the vague commotion to the east, past the rising poles, seems worth seeing.
