The livers seem to prick you for a moment, as if to say you're not quite right.

The sliver seems to bend, but it snaps back. As if it's impatient to do or be more, but it hasn't served its purpose as-is, yet.

You currently have 13 out of 17 total points for the Forest region. You have found all the secret points in the region, so you will get the maximum score once you solve it.

They look forbidding, but you might turn them into something worse. Maybe you can just dispose of them physically.

The drapes are too thick.

>cut drapes
The drapes vanish as they are cut, revealing ... well, something leading somewhere. A voice whispers "Enter the missend dimness ... if you dare." Mis-send or miss-end? Either way, you probably need to be prepared.

The bog expands into a big ol' gob and sucks you down. Congratulations, there aren't many ways to die in this game, but you found one. At least you didn't have to suffer through any melodrama from the Bluth family as you died.
