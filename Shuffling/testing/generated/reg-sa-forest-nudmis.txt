Giving yourself or the cruel ones an ulcer would be pointless.

#mistake test for god

You want to tempt the supernatural in somewhere this hellish? Phew.

#mistake test for gob
>gob
The bog expands into a big ol' gob and sucks you down. Congratulations, there aren't many ways to die in this game, but you found one. At least you didn't have to suffer through any melodrama from the Bluth family as you died.
Oh, and you can undo this, too.
