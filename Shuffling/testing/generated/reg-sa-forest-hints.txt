/^Self-ID Fields

Go east and west and look around a bit. There're only three rooms to start, and passing Corses Crosse needs stuff from each side room. While you can still hint an object, HINT will only give you this nag until you visit all three locations.

You see yourself putting something on your face and then walking through Corses Crosse with ease.
