You're not in the area where the magic happens, yet. The cardinal directions, including the boring lecture east, are out. There's only one way to go.
!Note: the plus sign means you can HINT again for something more spoilery. (-) means the end of a list of hints.

>in
Rested Desert

What can the odor turn into? Your random thoughts are not so random. (+)

>z
The clues and distractions collapse to anagrams. (+)
>z
If you get to the end, you'll notice two rather forced ones. They both anagram odor. What else do they anagram? (+)
>z
A door. (-)
A minus sign means you've reached the end of a hint loop. You can cycle through them again, though.

>gt subsite
Goodness, no.

>n
The size of the desert, um, deters you. You're steer'd back to the odor.
!The one you can probably go through.

You hit a snag, and the toga nags you. Or seems to.

>gt subsite
Goodness, no.

>gt rested desert
The door from Rested Desert was one-way. You can't even see it now.

!You suppress an insult that would maybe only make sense if the darnels were sentient.

Notices Section

DEBUG: magenta nametag being objhinted.
>monty glean
You need to take the phial for that to happen. The cabinet may not want to relinquish it right away. Maybe find someone to ask.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-anagrams-static
>xx static
You stop and think. The static doesn't seem as important as that gateway. Do so anyway?
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead the static seems to form attics near the doll house.

>gt desert
The door from Rested Desert was one-way.

>gt thickets
You can't see the passage back to the Thickets.

>gt subsite
Goodness, no.

>n
You hear tectonic noises, then an evil voice whispering "Once it's..." You sense running away wouldn't work. Through the gateway it is, though it'd be nice to have some help.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-anagrams-attics
>xx attics
After some thought, that seems like it'd be a waste, since you know what they were. You can probably change things back, if you want.

>score
You currently have 7 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You have found all the secret points in the region, so you will get the maximum score once you solve it.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-anagrams-nametag
>xx nametag
You pause a bit. Maybe there's something on the broad board that'd help you decide what to do with the nametag. Or what not to do.

>x board
You hear a big VOOP. The writing on the board is replaced by even more writing, but not before you write some basic stuff down in your notepad.DEBUG: pad-reccing retry.

>xx nametag
You pause a bit. Maybe there's something more on the broad board that'd help you decide what to do with the nametag. Or what not to do.

>x board
Mt. Egana

>xx nametag
You pause a bit. Maybe there's something you can re-read on the broad board that'd help you decide what to do with the nametag. Or what not to do.

Well, you probably just need to get through with things. You take a bite of the saltine, then you think "How do I get through that gate, man?" Hmm...

>gateman
Your score has just gone up by one point.

You need to take the phial for that to happen. The cabinet may not want to relinquish it right away. Maybe ask the gateman.

You probably want to TAKE GADGET before entering the gate. Well, maybe even TAKE ALL.

>n
You hear tectonic noises, then an evil voice whispering "Once it's..." You sense running away wouldn't work. Through the gateway it is!

>score
You currently have 8 out of 8 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions and get the tagged gadget, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-loader-anagrams-acne-bit-cabinet
>xx cabinet
Some aftertaste from the saltine doesn't feel great. You wonder if this is the best way to use your vision. Use it anyway?
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see some Bactine.

>take gadget
As you pick it up, you see it's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
Nat Egam nods. "Take good care of it. Well, it's hard to break, so don't feel you'll wear it out. I'm proud of what I can make it do ... and  yet ... I have some ideas for a new version, maybe far in the future, if worse evil comes to Yorpwald. Anyhoo."

>ask gateman about cabinet

(taking the phial first)
The cabinet's doors seem to waver a bit, but they don't slam on you.
You stare into the blue lube for a bit. You see a small story unfold.
You see Nat Egam sneaking up from behind you and smacking you on the head, saying to get going already...
And a few seconds later, he does. Well, the clairvoyance bit seems to work.

>z
You see Nat Egam sneaking up from behind you and smacking you on the head, saying to get going already...
And a few seconds later, he does. Again. Hooray for double-checking, I think.

You can just enter the gate now.

>get saltine
Got it. You'd have liked a beefier freebie, but with calm opining, you see no use complaining.
!Taken.
