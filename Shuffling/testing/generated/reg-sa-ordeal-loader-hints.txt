>monty hints
You're not in the area where the magic happens, yet. The cardinal directions, including the boring lecture east, are out. There's only one way to go.
!Note: the plus sign means you can HINT again for something more spoilery. (-) means the end of a list of hints.

>in
Rested Desert

What can the odor turn into? Your random thoughts are not so random. (+)

>z
The clues and distractions collapse to anagrams. (+)
>z
If you get to the end, you'll notice two rather forced ones. They both anagram odor. What else do they anagram? (+)
>z
A door. (-)
A minus sign means you've reached the end of a hint loop. You can cycle through them again, though.

>gt subsite
Goodness, no.

>n
The size of the desert, um, deters you. You're steer'd back to the odor.
!The one you can probably go through.

Thickest Thickets

DEBUG: toga being objhinted.

>n
You hit a snag, and the toga nags you. Or seems to.

>gt subsite
Goodness, no.

>gt rested desert
The door from Rested Desert was one-way. You can't even see it now.

!You suppress an insult that would maybe only make sense if the darnels were sentient.

You can just go IN, now.

Notices Section

DEBUG: magenta nametag being objhinted.
>monty glean
You need to take the phial for that to happen. The cabinet may not want to relinquish it right away. Maybe find someone to ask.

>gt desert
The door from Rested Desert was one-way.

>gt thickets
You can't see the passage back to the Thickets.

>gt subsite
Goodness, no.

>n
You hear tectonic noises, then an evil voice whispering "Once it's..." You sense running away wouldn't work. Through the gateway it is, though it'd be nice to have some help.

>attics
Your score has just gone up by one point.

>score
You currently have 6 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You have found all the secret points in the region, so you will get the maximum score once you solve it.

>gateman
Your score has just gone up by one point.

You need to take the phial for that to happen. The cabinet may not want to relinquish it right away. Maybe ask the gateman.

You probably want to TAKE GADGET before entering the gate. Well, maybe even TAKE ALL.

>score
You currently have 7 out of 7 total points for the Ordeal Loader region. You might want to ask the gateman a few more questions and get the tagged gadget, but you don't really have anything critical remaining to do here.

>take gadget
As you pick it up, you see it's a weird go-hint thingo, all right. The show hows tag dangling from it seems relatively free of legalese. You notice a tip in a pit on the side of the gadget.
Nat Egam nods. "Take good care of it. Well, it's hard to break, so don't feel you'll wear it out. I'm proud of what I can make it do ... and  yet ... I have some ideas for a new version, maybe far in the future, if worse evil comes to Yorpwald. Anyhoo."

>ask gateman about cabinet

(taking the phial first)
The cabinet's doors seem to waver a bit, but they don't slam on you.
You stare into the blue lube for a bit. You see a small story unfold.
You see Nat Egam sneaking up from behind you and smacking you on the head, saying to get going already...
And a few seconds later, he does. Well, the clairvoyance bit seems to work.

>z
You see Nat Egam sneaking up from behind you and smacking you on the head, saying to get going already...
And a few seconds later, he does. Again. Hooray for double-checking, I think.

You can just enter the gate now.

>get saltine
Got it. You'd have liked a beefier freebie, but with calm opining, you see no use complaining.
!Taken.
>eat saltine
coughs

>eat saltine
You reckon you can wait
