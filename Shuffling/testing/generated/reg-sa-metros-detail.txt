>ask deadbeat about blozhko
He mumbles something about chillin' with his ill chin and how you're probably down with the man's anthems and aligned with those yuppies to the north, glancing furtively at the lost corn, and he also complains about nerds down southish, for some reason.

>ask deadbeat about deadbeat
He mumbles "Mt. Rose Rots Me Moster" and giggles stupidly. You probably won't learn much from him except about instruments of subversion.

>ask deadbeat about beats
"They're nice and all for being an excuse not to work but they're lame and all because it's hard to concentrate for maximized angst. I'm tired of them, you square, yo."

The deadbeat doesn't believe in magic, now. But he did as a kid.

>ask deadbeat about red bull burdell
"He is oppressive, man, but he is just a symptom of disparity and malaise."

>ask deadbeat about poses posse
The deadbeat starts up some nonsense pseudo-sociological mumblings.

>ask deadbeat about lost corn
"Hey, Man, like, how do we know you don't, like, like the Man, man? Hey? Hey?"

The FREE TO FREELOADERS torn cue by the brocade vanishes as you take it. Nice magic touch, that.

>ask about xyzzy
"Hm, should we even talk to an outsider about that?"
"Well, if they found their way in, they can't be THAT dumb!"
"Well, they'll have to find the right thing to ASK NERDS like us about if they want us to stop talking about them like they're not here."
"Maybe they're a lateral thinker. Who knows several ways to get through things."
"GROAN! Nice Ignorance."
They don't seem to want to tell you what to ask them, out of principle, but if you keep nagging them, they may let some cryptic knowledge slip.
"If they don't know what to ask nerds about, they deserve ED'S SNARK!" Ed, indistinguishable otherwise from the rest, leaps, pleased with what elapsed.
>ask about xyzzy
More annoying banter. Perhaps you could disperse them with the right item. They'd deserve it.
>ask about xyzzy
Laugh-tons onslaught as you haven't figured what to ask nerds.
>ask about xyzzy
They form a grin ring, but you close your eyes a bit and girn! They compare your response to K. Sanders.
>ask about xyzzy
A hundred-nerd DUH follow your latest ask-nerds attempt.
>ask about xyzzy
"Maroon! A moron! You might as well ask dorks like Karkdoss about something that inconsequential!"
>ask about xyzzy
An argument on the virtues of code versus Frisbee golf follows, and how nobody would ask geeks like Kaergess for help getting better at either.
>ask about xyzzy
The nerds jokingly offer to send Sark in your place, maybe to find a left-handed veeblefitzer. You see red at the backhanded insult.
>ask about xyzzy
Apparently you haven't seen the light for what to ask nerds about. "We can wait here a thousand years!" one laughs. They debate on what's worse, dumb people in power or out.
>ask about xyzzy
One nerd tells you you should be sent to the red planet of SKASDREN for asking so many nagging questions.
>ask about xyzzy
One nerd calculates eight factorial over two factorial, that's 20160, and eventually you'll see the light.
>ask about xyzzy

>ask about xyzzy
Duhs won't shut down. Still, the nerds seem to be having fun, so they won't mind if you start over asking about stuff.
>ask nerds about dorks
They snicker knowingly. They assure you Karkdoss is the worst, if you want to ask dorks for any help.
>ask nerds about karkdoss
They snicker knowingly. You wonder if there is a Karkdoss, and if so, if they really think you should ask dorks.
>ask nerds about beats
"Anyone can be smart enough to build noise canceling homes to get rid of the beats!"
>ask nerds about controls
"Oh! These are simple controls! You don't even need to know about induction and charges and anything. Just slap them in where there's something missing. Pf, barely worth the time to ASK NERDS about."
>ask nerds about deadbeat
The nerds aren't big on social stuff. They're more about the technical stuff, about showing answers to questions you have. And questions you don't know you have yet.
>ask nerds about faeries
The nerds assure you science is better than magic.
>ask nerds about red bull burdell
"Sometimes Yorpwald is so dumb it deserves a thousand years of his rule. Not that he deserves to rule for a thousand years. We need someone smart enough to ASK NERDS the right thing to help dethrone him!"

While the other regions are linear, the Metros has five paths based on the flowers you choose from Fo' Real Florae Fare, Lo (two ways) and how you get the tulip (three ways). One way of getting the tulip requires a specific flower.
You could have gotten the begonias from Fo' Real Florae Fare, Lo.
--the other ways to get the tulip are to OPEN NOISE BAG in the Esoteric Coteries after getting the begonias or SHOW EMITTER TO DEADBEAT after using it in Obtains/Boastin' Bastion, then using it again in the Esoteric Coteries.
