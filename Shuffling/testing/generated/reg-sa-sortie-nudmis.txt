Trap Part

#mistake retest for turn [text]
>turn zozimus
You can probably TURN the dial to a number, e.g. 99.

#nudge for part
>patr
You need to manipulate something in the room to stop the spinning.
#nudge for sortie
>tosrie
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#nudge for centrifuge
>centrifueg
You're dizzy enough looking around without trying to focus on anything. The dial in the middle of the room seems to control it.
#nudge for frenetic
>frenetic
You're dizzy enough looking around without trying to focus on anything. The dial in the middle of the room seems to control it.
#nudge for exitsnw
>xeitsnw
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.
#nudge for exitssw
>xeitssw
The room seems to spin faster, as if you are totally on the wrong track.
#nudge for exitsse
>xeitsse
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.
#nudge for exits
>extis
You can't do much to the exits when you don't even know which way they are.
#nudge for dial
>dila
Messing up the dial would leave you trapped here.
#nudge for sextien
>esxtien
The spinning seems to slow a bit.
#nudge for mud
>mdu
The mud is just there. You can't change it.

#mistake test for a lid
>a lid
Changing the dial would leave you stuck.

#mistake retest for turn [text]
>turn zozimus
You can probably TURN the dial to a number, e.g. 99

>sixteen
#notana -- technically, it is, but it's handled through the dial code, so it could be a number. This is an odd one, but there you go.
by one point

#mistake retest for turn [text]
>turn zozimus
You can probably just SWITCH something with two text settings.

#mistake retest for a lid

You don't need to deal with the dial, now.

The Nick

#readables for great grate
>read great grate
The grate seems to be made by HECK TIN. It's not steel, but it's still too thick. The redness of HECK TIN surprises you a bit.

#nudge for graffiti
>graffiit
The graffiti's etched in solidly. But it seems like a decent clue, if you just want to read it.

#nudge for greta
>greta
The grate remains impassive.

#nudge for nick
>nikc
Maybe there is a way out of the nick. Not of nick, but the nick. It's probably too much to think yourself in K.C.

#nudge for sixteen
>ixsteen
You don't need to re-stop the centrifuge.

#spechelp for t-n
>kitchne
The nick blurs a little but snaps back to normal.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from all around. Keep at it.

#mistake test for thicken

You might rather thin-nen to slip through the bars, but you can't.

Kitchen

>open fridge
You see a grist and a cake pan inside. Hm, mostly instant-meal stuff, nothing nourishing enough for an adventurer, but maybe good for practice.
>open fridge
You reopen and peer on. You see a grist and a cake pan inside.

>xx
Nothing really sticks out. You may have to XX something specific.
>xx grist
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see grits.
>xx cake pan
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see a pancake.
>xx cathouse
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see large packet of HOTSAUCE.
>xx tall trio
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see a tortilla.

>score
You currently have 2 out of 27 total points for the Sortie region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 25, and the maximum is 27

#mistake test for limes
>limes
I think you have the wrong food group. Besides, it wouldn't be nice to wipe the spearman's smile off.

#mistake test for pears
>pears
I think you have the wrong food group. The spearman is cheesy. Plus, he wouldn't be a spearman without his spear.

#nudge for rendin
>rendni
You don't need to change the red inn. It will support your cooking efforts.
#mistake retest for thicken
>thicken
This would be the place, but you're not hungry for anything TOO fatty right now
#nudge for ditties
>dittise
Don't let the songs distract you from your mission.
#nudge for grief
>grife
The fridge has taken enough abuse and can't be changed for the better, but maybe you can fix something inside it.
#nudge for spear
>spera
The spearman is what's important.

>s
Trap Part
A round den, unadorned. A lid lies where once the dial laid. Exits lie north and east, and they've been behaving since you fixed that dial!

#nudge for aroundden
>aroundden
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start constantly giving readings then, anyway.

#renudge for dial
>dila
The dial did its part for you.

#nudge for kitchen
>ketchin
You can just walk to the kitchen. There's no need to revisit the nick, and there's no third location between them.

>n

#nudge for kitchne
>ketchin
Nothing happens. Well, you didn't really want to go back to the nick, and there's probably no third room to look for between the two. Maybe you need to escape this bunker from another room.

>x fridge
While its brand is (of course) DEF-RIG, it's not exactly top-of-the-line, but it seems to work. A manila animal forms a lamina over it. In the fridge, you see grist and cake pan. Written in dust (which you rub off and copy to your notepad) you see NO, TOO STUPID A FAD. I PUT SOOT ON WARTS.

#nudge for lamina
>lamian
It actually looks pretty nice on the fridge.

#nudge for pan
>pna
It's not a cake, and it's not quite a pan--it's a cake pan.

#nudge for cake
>caek
It's not a cake, and it's not quite a pan--it's a cake pan.

#nudge for fridge

#nudge for packet

Fiddling with sauce packets is so awful! Until it's easy. And it should be, here. Just PUT the sauce on any food.

#nudge for cheesy
>cheeys
It's more that he's a spearman--but maybe his cheesiness is a clue.

#readables for spearman
>take spearman
As you pick up the spearman, you notice something on the bottom. Perhaps you could READ the spearman to see what it is.
!Taken.

#nudge for lois

Changing Lois is highly unlikely, and you should possess the oils before doing anything with them.

>cask
The sack stiffens, rises and becomes less blobby. It's the cask again, nice and upright.

#mistake retest for lois
>lois
Lois will not pour the oils in the cask for you, but she is not stopping you. Lois helps those who help themselves.

>pour oils
Gainly laying the cask under the spout, you pour in some oils.

>w
You hear a creaking above as you exit. You see the trellis's archings crashing on you and quickly run from under them. The archings smash against each other, and their rubble blocks the hallway. You hear a voice. It must be Lois. "WIN," she whines.

Crashing Archings

#nudge for arching
>archign
Neither arching shakes. They're probably too sturdy, and you're probably not meant to go back.

#nudge for crashing

You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside. Your gadget would probably start constantly giving readings then, anyway.

#done rejects for silo

That silo was pretty big. You probably have little more to do with the oils.

>put panel in silo
The panel fits into that rectangle handily and even starts to glow. Two buttons appear on it--one says HOOTS, the other TREES. "Panel fits. Final step," you muse.

>put door in silo
The door fits the dotted line in the silo perfectly, swinging slightly before sliding in place with a click.

>put missile in silo
You schlep the missile through the door. You hear some mechanics and whizzing. A luster-result rustle, if you will. Then "SMILIES MISSILE DEALING-ALIGNED!"
