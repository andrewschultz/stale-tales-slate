/^Trap Part

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-turn-text
>turn zozimus
You can probably TURN the dial to a number, e.g. 99.

#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-part
>patr
You need to manipulate something in the room to stop the spinning.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-sortie
>tosrie
You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-centrifuge
>centrifueg
You're dizzy enough looking around without trying to focus on anything. The dial in the middle of the room seems to control it.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-frenetic
>frenetic
You're dizzy enough looking around without trying to focus on anything. The dial in the middle of the room seems to control it.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-exitsnw
>xeitsnw
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-exitssw
>xeitssw
The room seems to spin faster, as if you are totally on the wrong track.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-exitsse
>xeitsse
The room seems almost ready to start to slow down. Maybe the exits aren't quite that way.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-exits
>extis
You can't do much to the exits when you don't even know which way they are.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-dial
>dila
Messing up the dial would leave you trapped here.
#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-sextien
>esxtien
The spinning seems to slow a bit.
#ttc-table-of-sortie-nudges-mud
>mdu
The mud is just there. You can't change it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-a-lid
>a lid
Changing the dial would leave you stuck.

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-turn-text
>turn zozimus

>sixteen
#notana -- technically, it is, but it's handled through the dial code, so it could be a number. This is an odd one, but there you go.
by one point

#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-turn-text
>turn zozimus
You can probably just SWITCH something with two text settings.

You currently have 1 out of 27 total points for the Sortie region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 25, and the maximum is 27

#renudge for part
>patr
You don't want to go back to how the Trap Part was.

You don't need to deal with the dial, now.

/^The Nick

#ttc-table-of-readables-great-grate
>read great grate
The grate seems to be made by HECK TIN. It's not steel, but it's still too thick. The redness of HECK TIN surprises you a bit.

#ttc-table-of-the-nick-nudges-graffiti
>graffiit
The graffiti's etched in solidly. But it seems like a decent clue, if you just want to read it.

#ttc-table-of-the-nick-nudges-greta
>greta
The grate remains impassive.

#ttc-table-of-the-nick-nudges-nick
>nikc
Maybe there is a way out of the nick. Not of nick, but the nick. It's probably too much to think yourself in K.C.

#ttc-table-of-sortie-nudges-sixteen
>ixsteen
You don't need to re-stop the centrifuge.

#ttc-table-of-sortie-spechelp-t-n
>kitchne
The nick blurs a little but snaps back to normal.
DEBUG NOTE FOR WHAT IS SEEN IN RELEASE: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from all around. Keep at it.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-thicken
>thicken
You might rather thin-nen to slip through the bars, but you can't.

>kitchen

/^Kitchen

>open fridge
You see some grist and a cake pan inside. Hm, mostly instant-meal stuff, nothing nourishing enough for an adventurer, but maybe good for practice.
>open fridge
You reopen and peer on. You see some grist and a cake pan inside.

>score
You currently have 2 out of 27 total points for the Sortie region. Your minimum possible score on solving is 25, and the maximum is 27

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-limes
>limes
I think you have the wrong food group. Besides, it wouldn't be nice to wipe the spearman's smile off.

#testcase-mistake-shuffling-pears
>pears
I think you have the wrong food group. The spearman is cheesy. Plus, he wouldn't be a spearman without his spear.

#ttc-table-of-kitchen-nudges-rendin
>rendni
You don't need to change the red inn. It will support your cooking efforts.
#+testcase-mistake-shuffling-thicken
>thicken
This would be the place, but you're not hungry for anything TOO fatty right now
#ttc-table-of-kitchen-nudges-ditties
>dittise
Don't let the songs distract you from your mission.
#ttc-table-of-kitchen-nudges-grief
>grife
The fridge has taken enough abuse and can't be changed for the better, but maybe you can fix something inside it.
#ttc-table-of-kitchen-nudges-spear
>spera
The spearman is what's important.

>s
/^Trap Part
A round den, unadorned. A lid lies where once the dial laid. Exits lie north and east, and they've been behaving since you fixed that dial!

#ttc-table-of-trap-part-nudges-aroundden
>aroundden
Unless a room has no way out, or your gadget spontaneously gives a reading, you probably won't need to act on the whole room.

#renudge for dial
>dila
The dial did its part for you.

#ttc-table-of-sortie-nudges-kitchen
>ketchin
You can just walk to the kitchen. There's no need to revisit the nick, and there's no third location between them.

>n

#ttc-table-of-kitchen-nudges-kitchne
>ketchin
Nothing happens. Well, you didn't really want to go back to the nick, and there's probably no third room to look for between the two. Maybe you need to escape this bunker from another room.

>x fridge
While its brand is (of course) DEF-RIG, it's not exactly top-of-the-line, but it seems to work. A manila animal forms a lamina over it. In the fridge, you see some grist and a cake pan. Written in dust (which you rub off and copy to your notepad) you see NO, TOO STUPID A FAD. I PUT SOOT ON WARTS.

#ttc-table-of-kitchen-nudges-lamina
>lamian
It actually looks pretty nice on the fridge.

#ttc-table-of-kitchen-nudges-pan
>pna
It's not a cake, and it's not quite a pan--it's a cake pan.

#ttc-table-of-kitchen-nudges-cake
>caek
It's not a cake, and it's not quite a pan--it's a cake pan.
