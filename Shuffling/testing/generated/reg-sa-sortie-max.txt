Kitchen

>x fridge
While its brand is (of course) DEF-RIG, it's not exactly top-of-the-line, but it seems to work. A manila animal forms a lamina over it. It doesn't appear locked or anything. You could just OPEN it. Written in dust (which you rub off and copy to your notepad) you see NO, TOO STUPID A FAD. I PUT SOOT ON WARTS.

>open fridge
You see some grist and a cake pan inside. Hm, mostly instant-meal stuff, nothing nourishing enough for an adventurer, but maybe good for practice.
>open fridge
You reopen and peer on. You see some grist and a cake pan inside.

#ttc-table-of-kibitzes-tall-trio
# note a weird case here: the colors will be displayed, since it is the first time, even though it is not strictly a kibitz test.
>rc tall trio
The gadget beeps once. A series of lights comes across: GRRRRRRR (R = red, G = green).
You scanned each of the tall trio, and the readout didn't change.
Most of the screen goes blue. Then a green dot and red dot bounce left and right across the gadget screen until they stabilize: GRBBBBBB (R = red, G = green, B = blue).

#pre-room-moor rule

You see a flash and get a glimpse of the moor, but your movement's gummed up quickly by the ooze below. Best to find something better to put on your feet.

You see a flash and get a glimpse of a moor, but it is just too cold. You blink and find yourself back in the room. You'll need to pierce the recipe to build something warm that can cover the rest of your body than just the shoes.

The moor sways a bit. You do some brief mental calculation. There's no third place between the room and the moor.

>pour oils
Fluids would leak through the sack. The cask you had would be better.

>cask
The sack stiffens, rises and becomes less blobby. It's the cask again, nice and upright.

>pour oils
Gainly laying the cask under the spout, you pour in some oils.
!A voice calls SO NOW HALLS SHALL SWOON. You're pretty sure it has a particular one in mind. You hope you've gotten what you need.

#pre-cask-sack rule
>sack
That's inadvisable. The oils would leak out.

#pre-oils-soil rule

This is not a good place to put soil. Somewhere more wide open, where you can pour the oils, too?

You'd need to fold the poem into a plane, first.

You fold the paper, and it looks sort of like a paper plane.

You hear a creaking above as you exit. You see the trellis's archings crashing on you and quickly run from under them. The archings smash against each other, and their rubble blocks the hallway. You hear a voice. It must be Lois. "WIN," she whines.

>put panel in silo
The panel fits into that rectangle handily and even starts to glow. Two buttons appear on it--one says HOOTS, the other TREES. "Panel fits. Final step," you muse.

>put door in silo
The door fits the dotted line in the silo perfectly, swinging slightly before sliding in place with a click.

>put missile in silo
You schlep the missile through the door. You hear some mechanics and whizzing. A luster-result rustle, if you will. Then "SMILIES MISSILE DEALING-ALIGNED!"

"AMUSING GUNS! AIM!" The silo makes some ominous VVTT-KLK-BRRW noises and tilts slightly in the direction of what you assume and hope is Mean Old Mondale-Doleman's palace.
