You notice some warts on your face. Stress causes them, you know, and between the centrifuge and the nick, you've had a bit lately.

>x fridge
While its brand is (of course) DEF-RIG, it's not exactly top-of-the-line, but it seems to work. A manila animal forms a lamina over it. It doesn't appear locked or anything. It may or may not be useful, but it looks easy to OPEN. Written in dust (which you rub off and copy to your notepad) you see NO, TOO STUPID A FAD. I PUT SOOT ON WARTS.
