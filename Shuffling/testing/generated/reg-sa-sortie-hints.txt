>x fridge
While its brand is (of course) DEF-RIG, it's not exactly top-of-the-line, but it seems to work. A manila animal forms a lamina over it. In the fridge, you see grist and cake pan. Written in dust (which you rub off and copy to your notepad) you see NO, TOO STUPID A FAD. I PUT SOOT ON WARTS.

Sacred Cedars

Once you change the sack to a cask, you can FILL CASK here, to start.

>cask
The sack stiffens, rises and becomes less blobby. It's the cask again, nice and upright.

You can FILL CASK here, to start.

>pour oils
Gainly laying the cask under the spout, you pour in some oils.
!A voice calls SO NOW HALLS SHALL SWOON. You're pretty sure it has a particular one in mind. You hope you've gotten what you need.

You can't pour the oils anywhere in this enclosed area. Try going back to the moor.
