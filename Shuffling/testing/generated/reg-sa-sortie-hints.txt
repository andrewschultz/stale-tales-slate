You see yourself flipping the dial back and forth about six or seven times. It all seems to end with some sort of rocket hitting a huge building. But there is no explosion, just rainbows and bubbles. Weird.

DEBUG: dial being objhinted.

Trap Part

>xx dial
The number sixteen takes prominence on the dial for a moment. You shake your head, and it disappears. Weird.

>gt trap part
You're already here. Or there. The precise grammar's neither here nor there.

>angle
You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. You notice a weird haze around the dial for a few seconds.

>w
You can't get your bearings long enough to lurch at or through an exit. You're getting hit with a lot of G's.
Maybe if you could figure out which directions the exits should be, you could figure the number to set the dial to.

>sixteen
#notana -- technically, it is, but it's handled through the dial code, so it could be a number. This is an odd one, but there you go.

Things look hazy. You find yourself in a cell, which is a bit scary, but you can't stay here.

The Nick

You see yourself patting your stomach.

DEBUG: great grate being objhinted.
>xx great grate
You let your eyes wander.
Your vision swirls, and you see a kitchen.

>e
You're trapped. If only the nick could be changed to something more to your taste.

That's not the magic way out. Sorry!

The nick glows all around.

Kitchen

It's a kitchen. You need to make something. But there are no ingredients around--just weird non-food items. Hmm.

>angle
You stare into the blue lube for a bit, then look around. You notice weird hazes around the tall trio, the cult tee, the skate, the cheesy spearman and the bottle of CATHOUSE perfume for a few seconds. Your warts also tingle.

>open fridge
You see a grist and a cake pan inside. Hm, mostly instant-meal stuff, nothing nourishing enough for an adventurer, but maybe good for practice.
>open fridge
You reopen and peer on. You see a grist and a cake pan inside.

>xx
Nothing really sticks out. You may have to XX something specific.

While its brand is (of course) DEF-RIG, it's not exactly top-of-the-line, but it seems to work. A manila animal forms a lamina over it. In the fridge, you see grist and cake pan. Written in dust (which you rub off and copy to your notepad) you see NO, TOO STUPID A FAD. I PUT SOOT ON WARTS.

After some thought, that seems like it'd be a waste, since you know what it was. It may be worth changing the sack back, depending on what you want to carry, though.

You see your face clear again, pleased you reversed the warts.

Once you change the sack to a cask, you can FILL CASK here, to start.

There is no other way except back west. Anyway, you might find scared cadres you aren't equipped to deal with, or scarce dreads.

The sack stiffens, rises and becomes less blobby. It's the cask again, nice and upright.

You can FILL CASK here, to start.

Gainly laying the cask under the spout, you pour in some oils.
