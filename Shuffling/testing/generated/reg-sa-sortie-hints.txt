You see yourself flipping the dial back and forth about six or seven times. It all seems to end with some sort of rocket hitting a huge building. But there is no explosion, just rainbows and bubbles. Weird.

DEBUG: dial being objhinted.

>xx dial
The number sixteen takes prominence on the dial for a moment. You shake your head, and it disappears. Weird.

#testcase-outside-trap-part
>exit
You can't get your bearings long enough to lurch at or through an exit. You're getting hit with a lot of G's.
Maybe if you could figure out which directions the exits should be, you could figure the number to set the dial to.

#notana -- technically, it is, but it's handled through the dial code, so it could be a number. This is an odd one, but there you go.

While its brand is (of course) DEF-RIG, it's not exactly top-of-the-line, but it seems to work. A manila animal forms a lamina over it. In the fridge, you see some grist and a cake pan. Written in dust (which you rub off and copy to your notepad) you see NO, TOO STUPID A FAD. I PUT SOOT ON WARTS.
