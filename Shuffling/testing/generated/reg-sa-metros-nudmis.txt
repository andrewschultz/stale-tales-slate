#mistake test for lira

But you're nowhere near Turkey or Lebanon or Syria. Or Italy or Israel, which don't use lira any more anyway. Plus, you don't need money.

#nudge for tramline

You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.

There aren't many ways to look at THIS art, and none are constructive, you sense.

It's not just that it's neon, it's that it's a pig.

#nudge for pgi

It's not just that it's a pig, it's that it's neon.

The neon pig blinks as if in last-ditch defiance.

That'd be neat, make the wall sticky so you could climb and deal with that opening you made...but you might get stuck to it, too. Need something clingy but less gooey.
#nudge for nope

You already transformed the neon pig to the gin-nope opening. Might be better to see if anything fits there.

You've already made nothing out of something, and instead of reversing that, you may need to put something in the opening.

The Velcro strip is just the thing to climb the cafe face and reach the small recess.

#mistake retest for smitten
>smitten
No matter how hard you try to convince yourself they are lovely, you're not smitten with them. They're just ugly. But they stuck really well on the cafe face.

#renudge for gin

You already transformed the neon pig to the gin-nope opening. And you put the controls in. Better not do any more.

You don't need to close up the opening. The controls are in, and they fill it well enough.

Horsing around like that won't hold back the beats. You need to get a grip another way, but you're on the right track.

No water source. You can do better than short-circuiting the siren with water, though.
