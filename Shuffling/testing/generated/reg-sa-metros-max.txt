You can't see anything like that here. If you're trying to view the room, L or LOOK should work.

A reading (well, a bunch of papers) has blown in since last time you were here. It's soggy from the drainage where it landed.

#ttc-table-of-kibitzes-drainage
>rc drainage
Most of the screen goes blue. Then a green dot and red dot bounce left and right across the gadget screen until they stabilize: BBRBBBGB (R = red, G = green, B = blue).
The gadget beeps once. A series of lights comes across: RRRRRRRR (R = red, G = green).
Hmm, you may need a lot to figure this. Maybe if you're stuck, you can combine this with a reading.

The gadget beeps once. A series of lights comes across: RRRRGG.
Most of the screen goes blue. Then a green dot and red dot bounce left and right across the gadget screen until they stabilize: BBRGBB.
Since Motto is only five letters, you wonder what's up, but it's labeled A MOTTO.

#pre-words-sword rule
>sword
The words become a sword, too large and terrifying to carry. The talk resumes as the sword disappears. You'll probably need something to put the sword, or the words, in.

The dead beat deadbeat might not beat you dead, but you'd get maligned ere legerdemain.
In other words, you probably need to gain the deadbeat's trust before taking any stuff.

#pre-drycake-keycard rule
>keycard
The poses posse would have something to talk about at their next get-together. Like the weirdo who did something scary to that cake and got arrested.
So, though you never know when a keycard is handy, Ix-nay on the agic-may 'til they're gone.
[That's worth noting in your notepad for later, so you do, once again, under FLIPS.]

##nudge for lost

It's not just that it's lost, it's CORN. Perhaps you can ask the deadbeat about the lost corn for more help.

#pre-heaths-sheath rule

The heaths are (still) merchandise. You don't want to find out what faeries do to vandals, or shoplifters, or combinations thereof.

You open the bag, and you feel the waves and sounds of the words swirling into the bag. You close it.
>sword
#pre-words-sword rule retry
The words become nastier for a second, forming into a sword, which heads for the noise bag. You're worried the sword might tear the noise bag apart, but before that happens, the sword dematerializes back into words.
It was the wrong shape for the bag, anyway. Maybe the bag could hold the words if you just OPEN it, though, being a noise bag.

You turn your back and focus so the faeries can't see you mangle their gift. Or so they aren't jealous, or they don't laugh at how dumb your magic is

While the other regions are linear, the Metros has five paths based on the flowers you choose from Fo' Real Florae Fare, Lo (two ways) and how you get the tulip (three ways). One way of getting the tulip requires a specific flower.
You could have gotten the begonias from Fo' Real Florae Fare, Lo.

--the other ways to get the tulip are to OPEN NOISE BAG in the Esoteric Coteries after getting the begonias or SHOW EMITTER TO DEADBEAT after using it in Obtains/Boastin' Bastion, then using it again in the Esoteric Coteries.
