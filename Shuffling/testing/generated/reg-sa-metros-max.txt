The poses posse would have something to talk about at their next get-together. Like the weirdo who did something scary to that cake and got arrested.
So, though you never know when a keycard is handy, Ix-nay on the agic-may 'til they're gone.
(That's worth noting in your notepad for later, so you do, once again, under FLIPS.)

The words become nastier for a second, forming into a sword, which heads for the noise bag. You're worried the sword might tear the noise bag apart, but before that happens, the sword dematerializes back into words.
It was the wrong shape for the bag, anyway. Maybe the bag could hold the words if you just OPEN it, though, being a noise bag.

You hear a bunch of weird noises! There's a distinct lack of buzzers, which you take as a good sign. Then a tinny voice drones "Impression:
 permission!" until it dies out. The signers' ingress opens slightly, to indicate you may enter now.
[NOTE: Shuffling Around will just let you walk through the signers' ingress at will now, so don't worry about swiping the card again.]

While the other regions are linear, the Metros has five paths based on the flowers you choose from Fo' Real Florae Fare, Lo (two ways) and how you get the tulip (three ways). One way of getting the tulip requires a specific flower.
You could have gotten the begonias from Fo' Real Florae Fare, Lo.
