There's a residence north, a library west, a flower shop east, and a seedier area south. But there are no special exits or clear way INSIDE.

The dead beat deadbeat eyes you warily. You probably can't take the corn until you pleased the deadbeat, but yay for looking ahead.
Your vision blurs a bit, and instead you see controls.

Perhaps there is a I-Be-Libel Lie Bible somewhere in the recesses here, but it and those beats would be too much at once. You probably just want to go back east.

#ttc-table-of-metros-anagrams-antlers

Some aftertaste from the saltine doesn't feel great. You wonder if this is the best way to use your vision. Use it anyway?

The brocade is free, whether or not you've helped the faeries. Why not take it?

The faeries want a flower. You have one in your inventory.

!Nothing works

>put card on sensor
You hear a bunch of weird noises! There's a distinct lack of buzzers, which you take as a good sign. Then a tinny voice drones "Impression:
 permission!" until it dies out. The signers' ingress opens slightly, to indicate you may enter now.
[NOTE: Shuffling Around will just let you walk through the signers' ingress at will now, so don't worry about swiping the card again.]

Just go east.
