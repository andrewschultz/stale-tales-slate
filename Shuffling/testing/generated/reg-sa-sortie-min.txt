The sack stiffens, rises and becomes less blobby. It's the cask again, nice and upright.

>pour oils
Gainly laying the cask under the spout, you pour in some oils.

>w
You hear a creaking above as you exit. You see the trellis's archings crashing on you and quickly run from under them. The archings smash against each other, and their rubble blocks the hallway. You hear a voice. It must be Lois. "WIN," she whines.

>put panel in silo
The panel fits into that rectangle handily and even starts to glow. Two buttons appear on it--one says HOOTS, the other TREES. "Panel fits. Final step," you muse.

>put door in silo
The door fits the dotted line in the silo perfectly, swinging slightly before sliding in place with a click.

>put missile in silo
You schlep the missile through the door. You hear some mechanics and whizzing. A luster-result rustle, if you will. Then "SMILIES MISSILE DEALING-ALIGNED!"
