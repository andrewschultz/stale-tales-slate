That seems like it should work, but you sense you have not done enough yet. But maybe, soon, you will.

You already figured what to do here. PAD FLIPS for a refresher.

Your magic is not advanced enough to change Store P! Well, not this game!

Store P -> PRESTO in A Roiling Original

Hm, that seems right, but it doesn't work this game!

Store U -> ROUTES in A Roiling Original

Nice try, but that's next game! You do not need riches to beat Red Bull Burdell.

Store V -> TROVES in A Roiling Original

That should work--but it doesn't! Maybe the towers would be too big to tackle in the game in a series, anyway.

You can't see anything like that here. If you're trying to view the room, L or LOOK should work.

You convince the powers that be that you remember all the words from Store F and the forest.
You watch the scented descent crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!

You have the rank of solider soldier.

#ttc-table-of-warpcmds-sooth

You convince the powers that be that, in sooth, you really did run through Store I and the sortie earlier.
You watch the posted depots crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!

You convince the powers that be that the idea you didn't solve Store M and the Metros is nonsense.
You watch the trade tread crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!
