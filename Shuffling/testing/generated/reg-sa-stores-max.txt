That seems like it should work, but you sense you have not done enough yet. But maybe, soon, you will.

Your magic is not advanced enough to change Store P! Well, not this game!

Store P -> PRESTO in A Roiling Original
>routes
Hm, that seems right, but it doesn't work this game!
#ttc-table-of-preflip-clues-store-u
>pf
Store U -> ROUTES in A Roiling Original
>troves
Nice try, but that's next game! You do not need riches to beat Red Bull Burdell.
#ttc-table-of-preflip-clues-store-v
>pf
Store V -> TROVES in A Roiling Original
>towers
That should work--but it doesn't! Maybe the towers would be too big to tackle in the game in a series, anyway.
#ttc-table-of-preflip-clues-store-w
>pf
Store W -> TOWERS in A Roiling Original
>oyster
Nice try, but that's next game!

You convince the powers that be that you remember all the words from Store F and the forest.
You watch the scented descent crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!

#ttc-table-of-ranks-5
>score
You have the rank of solider soldier.

#ttc-table-of-warpcmds-sooth
>sooth
You convince the powers that be that, in sooth, you really did run through Store I and the sortie earlier.
You watch the posted depots crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!

#ttc-table-of-ranks-6
>score
You have the rank of a mature amateur.

#ttc-table-of-warpcmds-say-bs
>say bs
You convince the powers that be that the idea you didn't solve Store M and the Metros is nonsense.
You watch the trade tread crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!

#ttc-table-of-ranks-7
>score
You have the rank of new hero now here.
