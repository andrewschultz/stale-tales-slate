That seems like it should work, but you sense you have not done enough yet. But maybe, soon, you will.

You already figured what to do here. PAD FLIPS for a refresher.

Your magic is not advanced enough to change Store P! Well, not this game!

Store P -> PRESTO in A Roiling Original

Hm, that seems right, but it doesn't work this game!

Store U -> ROUTES in A Roiling Original

Nice try, but that's next game! You do not need riches to beat Red Bull Burdell.

Store V -> TROVES in A Roiling Original

That should work--but it doesn't! Maybe the towers would be too big to tackle in the game in a series, anyway.

You can't see anything like that here. If you're trying to view the room, L or LOOK should work.

#testcase-table-of-warpcmds-logoi
>logoi
You convince the powers that be that you remember all the words from Store F and the forest.
You watch the scented descent crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!

#testcase-table-of-ranks-5
>score
You have the rank of solider soldier.

#testcase-table-of-warpcmds-sooth
>sooth
You convince the powers that be that, in sooth, you really did run through Store I and the sortie earlier.
You watch the posted depots crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!

#testcase-table-of-ranks-6
>score
You have the rank of a mature amateur.

#testcase-table-of-warpcmds-say-bs

You convince the powers that be that the idea you didn't solve Store M and the Metros is nonsense.
You watch the trade tread crackle, fizzle, and disappear. You've now solved that area, by an entirely different magic than your main power. Hooray!
