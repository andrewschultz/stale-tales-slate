!--the rock on the Leis Isle was changeable to CORK.
!--the swing on the Leis Isle was changeable to WINGS.
!--the spore in the Rived Drive was changeable to ROPES. The sprig/spore was one way through, but the toolshed was the other.
!--the sprig in the Rived Drive was changeable to GRIPS.
!--the tool shed in the Rived Drive was changeable to TOEHOLDS for 2 points.
!--the chain links could've become china. [Note: to get this point, you need to change the (chain) links to china before making the kilns.]
