>try
That's more sensible than the five alternatives, but it's not concrete enough.

>no entry
You solved that puzzle already. Onward!

>dray
You don't have enough possessions to need a cart. You probably need somewhere to go, instead.

>rood
This game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

>doro
The odor doesn't seem too complex. You pause. You can figure what it should be.
You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the odor. Keep at it.
>door
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>doro
The door is probably the way out. Best not change it into something else.

You already changed the odor, and this game is religion-neutral or tries to be. Plus, a rood wouldn't lead anywhere.

>score
1 out of 7
You haven't solved any regions yet. You have the rank of reduced deducer.

You think back to a combination lock you had with, well, forty cubed possibilities. Only, hmm--twenty-four, here.
You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bolt. Keep at it.

>blto
You don't want to re-lock the door.

The bulge swells and makes a squeal, like it's trying to make music.
You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bulge. Keep at it.
>bugle
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>bugel
The bugle emits a sad "don't change me back" noise.

>use bugle
Use is a bit too general for this game's parser to understand. You can SWITCH something, or PUT something IN/ON something, or even ATTACH something to something. You can PUSH a button or OPEN something, as well. Specific items should clue you what to do if you EXAMINE them.

Thickest Thickets

>believe
Yes, but what do you believe you can do?

>gato
Nice try, but wrong language. Another animal would be more likely to eat through the thickets.

I award you zero points for that anagramming try, and may God have mercy on your soul. Okay, actually, you're close to one point.

There will be better hints than a manners advice column once you move on, though the darnels make you see red for a bit.

Hm, you can't think of anything to do with the attics but change them back.

Anything you do to bend the shades might break them.

Hey! Guns are dangerous! It won't be that easy to get one. Besides, changing the tag will break the tagged gadget.

Anything you do might violate firearm safety rules, or something.

If there were any treasure here, it'd probably do something terrible to you once you took it.
>cluer
This place is too stark to offer clues--well, maybe it'd offer WRONG clues.

>padres
Bringing holy men down here would probably kill them.
>rasped
The spread makes a raspy noise, but you probably need to think up something more concrete. Not, like, cement concrete.
>spader
James Spader is pretty cool, but he can't help with supernatural stuff. Okay, maybe he could, but I couldn't afford the appearance fee.

You can just read the spread instead. The messages here aren't cryptic enough to be parsed.
