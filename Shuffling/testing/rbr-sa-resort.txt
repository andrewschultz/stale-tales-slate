#spechelp for store r
>resotr
Store R remains impassive. "Or rest?" you muse. You're sort of ready for vacation, and sort of not.

#done rejects for ogled lodge

You already made passage to the ogled lodge. It's good enough. Why change it?

Astral Altars

@mis
#mistake test for lites

That's bad spelling, and it won't shrink your problems.

@nud

The feral flare crackles menacingly. You doubt you can change it for the better.
#spechelp for tiles
>islte
The tiles rattle as if to shift but settle down.
#readables for tiles
>read tiles
The tiles blur a bit as you (de)-focus just right. You see subtleties in the blues and brown that seem to spell out LEST I. But with the effort, your eyes water, and you see red a bit.
