You don't want to change a region drastically while you're in it.

#nudge for islet

#nudge for thesand
>thesadn
The sand is just--well, sand. It won't help you get off the island.

#dupnudge for islet
>tilse
Nothing happens. You may need to deal with something specific on the islet to leave.

#nudge for eter
>eter
The tree sits there, but the swing rocks a bit.

#nudge for oflat
>aftol
You notice writing on the rock and swing similar to what you just said. Or tried to say. Also, no need to make anything lo-fat here.

`nu
#spechelp for rock
>crko
Hmm, a rock, but only so much you can do with it.

>cork
by one point

`nu
#done rejects for cork
>crko
Your head swims then sinks as you realize the cork can't become much else.

#dupnudge for oflat

You have a way off this island to the east, though you can make the other for fun, too. Also, no need to make anything lo-fat here.

`nu
#spechelp for swing
>winsg
The swing goes slightly airborne.

>wings

`nu
#done rejects for wings
>winsg
The wings should be able to propel you enough.

#dupnudge for eter
>eter
The tree sits there.

>e
Rived Drive

#nudge for ulock
>ulokc
Nope. That lock's secure.

#nudge for lock
>lokc
Nope. That lock's secure.

#nudge for pole
>pelo
Only changing one pole would still leave a vertical barrier.

#spechelp for poles
>polse
The poles start to bend at an angle--or maybe that's the light.

by one point

#done rejects for slope
>pelso
You wouldn't want to make the slope crumble away.

>pirg

You can't get ahold of anything that would be more useful than the grips.

>e

Hotspot
#nudge for hotsopt
>hotspto
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room. Or it is just a room, and you need to get outside.

#nudge for rioters
>riotesr
They're just a riot. You may lump them together for your purposes. It'll be for society's good.

#nudge for rioter
>riotre
They're just a riot. You may lump them together for your purposes. It'll be for society's good.

No, the clay is a clue to what the protest really wants to do.

`nu
#spechelp for riot
>troi
The riot's still a crowd. A BIG crowd.
>trio

`nu
#done rejects for trio

No, the clay is a clue to what the trio really wants to do.

#nudge for protesters
>ersprotest
They're just a simple protest.

by one point

`nu
#done rejects for protest
>pottesr
You can deal with three people. But you'll have to change their motivations.

>pottre
Picking one person out of a crowd never works.

>pottesr
You cut the riot down, but you need to change their protest now.

#nudge for three
>ethre
The trio remains unmoved. Perhaps you can get the potters something to work with?

#nudge for chainlinks
>chainliskn
You're overthinking it. Or you hope you are. It's both a chain, and links.

>ainch
The links rattle slightly. Perhaps they are chaining others' creativity as well as your own, as they are now.

>china

`nu
#spechelp for chain links
>kilsn
WRONG

>kilns

#nudge for tugtoe

Red Bull Burdell snickers, but a bit uneasily, at--whatever you just said.

#nudge for burdell
>burdlle

#nudge for scar
>scar
Now's not the time for cosmetic stuff!

#nudge for crass
>crssa
Now's not the time for cosmetic stuff!

#nudge for cutlery
>cutleyr
Red Bull Burdell laughs at your puny attempt. There's no weakness in the cutlery--maybe somewhere, or something, else?

#nudge for tshirt
>tshirt
You slur out a few consonants--maybe you should work with something closer, lower down.

>tug toe

#nudge for manor
>romna
WRONG

#nudge for ransom
>ransmo
WRONG

>e
Means Manse

#nudge for manse
>mesna
You won't need to do anything to the whole room unless you are trapped in a room.

#nudge for extis
>extis
That's not quite the right sort of nothing.

#nudge for marble
>marbel
You don't even want to TRY any more anagrams. You just want to BE...and not even take any of the exits here.

#nudge for toaster
