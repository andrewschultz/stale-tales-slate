"Shuffling Around" by "Ned Yompus"

volume 1 - the main program

[I don't recommend building, though it is possible. You'll need a 6G version of Flexible windows. Most everything should be in https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/, but I won't give much help building my own programs. I have trouble enough myself!

Glulx Text Effects.i7x
Flexible Windows.i7x

are modified versions.

You may have some problems with Glulx Text Effects.i7x / Glulx Text Effects - New.i7x naming and getting duplicate tables. If you are getting an already defined table, make sure other extensions all point to one of the two. This is the big hurdle to building. I may need to sort this out or update modules if there are new ones.
]

[Given that the total source is over 900000 bytes, I've tried to provide a rough outline as well as places to look to find the tricky bits. The standard method of searching game text in the source will probably get you pretty far, but also, I used some search markers repeatedly when I needed to change something in this game.

Sa Random Text.i7x includes all the random text. It is searchable by xx(f,m,i,r,x) -- x is introductory names, and the others are the store the region is behind.

Sa Nudges.i7x includes all the nudges for good guesses. By good guesses I mean trying objects that can't be anagrammed.

TMC=table of megachatter, where all the random text is forked.
TON=table of nudges, where a good try is rejected, so the player knows they are on the wrong track. It's in Sa Nudges.i7x now.
TOA=table of anagrams, or the big one.
TOH=table of hint objects
TOSH=table of specialized help (for specific rejects, e.g. ELCISH for the liches)
AIP=check if action is procedural

book disambig

include Bypass Disambiguation by Climbing Stars.

rule for asking which do you mean (this is the bypass disambiguation rule):
	if current action is objasking or current action is objasking generically:
		say "Sorry, [one of]but you may not have been specific enough with what to ask for. I'm going to err on the side of caution instead of possibly disambiguating something you haven't seen. This is a possible coding bug (and I'd like to know,) but it may also prevent spoilers. For best results, you should try to visit the location of whatever you want hinted or be more detailed in your request[or]this request seems too vague. If this is a bug, let me know[stopping].";
		bypass disambiguation;
		the rule succeeds;
	continue the action;

the uberthorn is privately-named scenery in Thickest Thickets. "The thickets are plenty and thick-set (sorry,) a plant-kingdom comb-over with prickles all up and down it.

chapter Roman Manor

Roman Manor is east of Potshot Hotspot. "Your new home. Um, yo, here. Now. I could ramble about the marble, praise a spire, note the toaster rotates, or sanction what it contains, but really--you sense one last hurdle hurled in your way to happiness.[paragraph break]The darned [i]exits[r] are all around, making you worry about what was, or if you'll have more to do, but you just want to do less than nothing[if player has gadget]. Your gadget rattles for hopefully the last time[end if].". Roman Manor is in Resort.

check going outside in Manor:
	say "You just want to BE, now. You don't want to have anything to do with exits." instead;

check scaning final-exits:
	try scaning the location instead;

the final-exits are privately-named plural-named scenery in roman manor. "They are tempting you to adventure, but you'd rather be than do."

understand "exits" as final-exits when player is in roman manor.

the marble is amusing  scenery in roman manor. "It makes you calm and relaxed enough to sit back and do nothing with a purpose."

the spire is amusing scenery in roman manor. "It makes you calm and relaxed enough to sit back and do nothing with a purpose."

the toaster is amusing scenery in roman manor. description of toaster is "It's just a stupid harmless luxury, here for a last bit of cheap wordplay."

instead of doing something with the toaster:
	unless current action is progressive:
		continue the action;
	say "No more fiddling. You just want to sit back and let stuff sink in."

before going in roman manor (this is the clue final verb rule):
	say "[one of]You suddenly have ye taxin['] any-exit anxiety. Like you're in the middle of an exitstential crisis.[or]I best sit, be, you think.[or]Sit, ex-adventurer.[or]Where would you go? Texis, perhaps[or]Seeing exits just makes you want to...[or]Aww, c'mon, this one's just switching TWO WHOLE LETTERS. You had other tougher ones to MAKE it here! Maybe you're overthinking[stopping]." instead;

section existing

[the final verb, of course]

understand "sex it" as a mistake ("[if player is not in manor]Quit screwing around and focus on yourself. NO, not like THAT. Geez[else]You're not even up for THAT, now. You just want to BE[end if].")

existing is an action applying to nothing.

understand the command "exist" as something new.

understand "exist" as existing.

carry out existing:
	if player is in Roman Manor:
		say "That is all that's left to do. It's time to become an adventurer emeritus. Perhaps one day you will resume it, but for now, the allures of your laurels are too great. Doing without the outwith, you begin your being binge, a pure-wit write-up of the happiest epitaphs to your vaunted, er, adventure. Where IS that notepad?";
		say "[wfak][line break]I...what? End a pad with a deadpan: GIVE A HANG? DANG, I HAVE! TREMENDOUS = ME (ENDS TOUR).";
		reg-inc;
		now resort is solved;
		consider the notify score changes rule;
		say "[line break]Final rank: a smart gamin['] anagrammist.[paragraph break]...well, final, until you feel like playing the second installment in the Stale Tales Slate: [i]A Roiling Original[r].";
		sort table of megachatter in reverse table-size order;
		repeat through table of megachatter:
			sort mytab entry in blurb order;
		end the story finally;
	otherwise:
		say "You continue to exist. Perhaps this ability will come in handy some day." instead;

book lll

LLL is a region. Lalaland is in LLL. [LLL is only a region for backdrops.]

chapter lalaland

[this region/room is for items that have been consumed, but we don't want to recycle them. It's easier to check if they're off-stage or in Lalaland than to define a boolean. Well, for me, anyway.]

Lalaland is a room. "[bug-report] I have no idea how you got here. Definitely, let me know, so it doesn't happen to anyone else. This room should be inaccessible. Anything that appears here should be pretty much dealt with. Perhaps I could've used a boolean called dealt-with, but I didn't."

instead of doing something in lalaland:
	say "You probably need to undo things." instead;

chapter bullpen

[used for the cask and sack to indicate they're not done-with yet]

Bullpen is a room in LLL. "This is the bullpen. You should not see it."

teleporter is privately-named scenery in Bullpen.
