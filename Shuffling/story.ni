"Shuffling Around" by "Ned Yompus"

volume 1 - the main program

[I don't recommend building, though it is possible. You'll need a 6G version of Flexible windows. Most everything should be in https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/, but I won't give much help building my own programs. I have trouble enough myself!

Glulx Text Effects.i7x
Flexible Windows.i7x

are modified versions.

You may have some problems with Glulx Text Effects.i7x / Glulx Text Effects - New.i7x naming and getting duplicate tables. If you are getting an already defined table, make sure other extensions all point to one of the two. This is the big hurdle to building. I may need to sort this out or update modules if there are new ones.
]

[Given that the total source is over 900000 bytes, I've tried to provide a rough outline as well as places to look to find the tricky bits. The standard method of searching game text in the source will probably get you pretty far, but also, I used some search markers repeatedly when I needed to change something in this game.

Shuffling Random Text.i7x includes all the random text. It is searchable by xx(f,m,i,r,x) -- x is introductory names, and the others are the store the region is behind.

Shuffling Nudges.i7x includes all the nudges for good guesses. By good guesses I mean trying objects that can't be anagrammed, but they're descibed prominently enough. It contains nudges listed by region and in the rough order you find the room.

Shuffling Tables.i7x now contains the major tables for the game. You can search for them more easily in this file.

TOA=table of anagrams, or the big one. You can also search by store e.g. Store F = xxtfa
TOH=table of hint objects
TOSH=table of specialized help (for specific rejects, e.g. ELCISH for the liches)
AIP=check if action is procedural

Ancient note to self: there are many places to put in a SKIP UPCOMING RULEBOOK BREAK, but they're too minor to hunt down & probably dealt with better with PROCESS. Still, they'd be nice to fix, and anyone who helps me with this will get my gratitude and probably a place in the credits.

Got antsy, then nasty... more garnish, less sharing... stern rents, a splinter should rent slip... a testier treatise from his Taxman, Tan Max... claiming to feel raw and that the welfare era flew!

	set the pronoun it to night thing;
	continue the action;

description of Night Thing is "It's grown wrong, a gigantic hairy eyeless potato clearly not the right girth. And it's wired weird, with a cruel ulcer for a mouth. It seems more in the mood for bellowing than fighting, but it still probably doesn't belong in the hotel. It's too big to fight and too fearsome to get near. It appears to be sitting on some sort of mattress."

understand "potato" as night thing when night thing is fungible.

check showing something to the night thing: try giving noun to night thing instead;

check giving something to the night thing:
	if noun is tomato:
		say "It stops roaring a bit to sniff the tomato, but it clearly doesn't trust you, doesn't have arms, and doesn't understand or care why you'd hate if it bit off your hand along with the tomato. So you decide to back up a bit and throw the tomato.";

	say "It's roaring too much. It seems upset about something, and you look unlikely to help." instead;

section cruel ulcer

the cruel ulcer is a boring thing. it is part of the night thing. description of cruel ulcer is "It's nasty and yellowed and an indication maybe scaring people in the hotel is more stressful than you think. You wonder how food goes down there.". bore-text is "It's neither a clue-r nor lucre."

It just 'remembers' the shape of whatever sat on it for a long, long time[if emitter is off-stage][get-the-bump][else]. It doesn't seem to have held anything other than the termite emitter[end if]."

to say get-the-bump:
	say ". The bump in the mattress is obvious enough that you have to take another look. You find a small machine labeled, apparently, a termite emitter, and you take it";
	set the pronoun it to termite emitter;
	moot bump;
	now player has the emitter;

section bump

the bump is a boring thing. it is part of the mattress. description of the bump is "Why not examine the whole mattress instead?". bore-check of bump is the bore-bump rule.

this is the bore-bump rule:
	if current action is objhinting, say "(You decide to examine it before asking for hints.)[paragraph break]";
	say "On getting close to the bump you realize it's due to something wedged inside the mattress. You search around, find a small machine that is apparently a termite emitter, and take it.";
	moot bump;
	now player has the emitter;

understand "something" as bump when bump is part of the mattress and mattress is fungible.

does the player mean throwing the tomato at the night thing: it is very likely.

description of termite emitter is "It's a black box the side of maybe two CD cases stacked[if bastion-evac is true]. It's empty now, you hope[else]. It probably holds a lot of termites. You can switch it when you need to[end if]. Someone has scratched a circle with a line through it over a dollar sign[if bastion-evac is false]. You can't hear or see the termites that should be in there, but hey, faith[else if flies-in-emitter is true]. The deadbeat put some angst gnats in it for you[else].

description of Red Bull Burdell is "His face is covered with crass scars, and he's wearing a t-shirt saying 'THIRST' over some rage gear. He has a toe that sticks out--a partial bare foot inside a fear boot. You think back to Achilles for some reason."

to hello-bull:
	say "[wfak]Tremors re-storm. 'Eh, we fly!' / 'Why flee?' / 'Erm, it's Mister Smiter!' The potters have wheeled their kilns to a mowed meadow.[paragraph break]You hear a shout from the south and mad snorts from a sandstorm, then see a man too ham-nosed to be handsome. He washes down some walnuts of wan lust with liquid from one purple metal can labeled Sado-Soda, then a bottle of Renegade Green-Ade.[paragraph break]'I am RED BULL BURDELL!' he shouts, in a voice neither earthy nor hearty. 'Um, poser? Mo['] super Supremo!'[paragraph break]The size of a large hut, bellowing real thug laughter, he emits 'It's me! I'm set! Sit [']em! Mites-smite times! Roots, torso, rot so!'";

GET OUT!!!! My ideal time? IMMEDIATELY! Nuance is nuisance!'[paragraph break]He points at you, booming 'BRED? LUL. DULL REB!'[paragraph break]You muse to yourself: 'Maunder unarmed? Me? Un-rad.'

section cutlery

'Rematch, Mr. Cheat!' he squeaks, failing to reobtain his baritone or, indeed, consider your gender. 'My buffs! FFS, Y'bum!'[paragraph break]'No go, goon! No terms, monster!' You ignore the predator's teardrops through a rain of 'No fair!' and 'Violent, not evil!'[paragraph break]Then he moans 'No Mas,' and a wan NAW! 'I predate adepter. I...'[paragraph break]'Who? How?' you reply. He has no answer. He runs off, presumably to see Dr. Buell for that foot pain.[paragraph break]Ya won! No way![paragraph break]The area feels more ... suburban, now. There's even a name for the street you're on!"; [bold-ok]

book Means Manse

Means Manse is east of Potshot Hotspot. "Your new home. Um, yo, here. Now. I could ramble about the marble, praise a spire, or sanction what it contains, but really--you sense one last hurdle hurled in your way to happiness.[paragraph break]The last thing to do is to assure yourself you don't need to do any more. Perhaps you could just praise yourself or make the manse feel a bit more yours or even just ignore the exits (labeled X-ITES in red) and be yourself.

volume Meta Team

Meta Team is an unsolvable region. [Meta Team is only a region for stuff that's been in play but isn't any more.]

book Emerita Emirate

[this region/room is for items that have been consumed, but we don't want to recycle them. It's easier to check if they're off-stage or moot than to define a boolean. Well, for me, anyway.]

Emerita Emirate is a privately-named room in Meta Team. "[bug-report] I have no idea how you got here. Definitely, let me know, so it doesn't happen to anyone else. This room should be inaccessible. Anything that appears here should be pretty much dealt with. Perhaps I could've used a boolean called dealt-with, but I didn't."
