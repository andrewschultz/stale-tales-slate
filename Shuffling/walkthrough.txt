Walkthrough for Shuffling Around, an IFComp 2012 game by Andrew Schultz (schultz.andrew@sbcglobal.net) as Ned Yompus

Last updated 4/11/2017 for release 5. The different ways through have been tested to work. The game branches a bit near the end, and I try to cover all these things.

I put in a lot of spaces so as not to spoil things. There are three sections you can complete in any order, in the middle of the game, before store r. For IFComp, you only had to complete two. For this, you can complete all three, or you can activate the RECUSE button to get all two.

You may wish to search for the following: intro, store f, store i, store m, store r.

*********** intro

> in

> door
> bugle
> play bugle
> in

> goat

There's a last lousy point with the darnels. Neither SANDLER nor LANDERS works. In fact, this sort of breaks the game's rules, but it IS a last lousy point.

>slander

> in

> gateman
> x cabinet (this & next bit before entering gate optional but recommended)
> take all (Oops! Can't take dollhouse)
> scan dollhouse
> attics
> static
> attics
> getaway

(You have all you need now, but you may want to get this information.)

> read board
> read info-lit
> ask about mumblety-peg
> ask about cabinet
> ask about quest
> ask about general advice
> ask about goat
> ask about redness
> ask about saltine
> ask about gadget
> ask about red bull burdell
> ask about redness
> get phial
> enter gate

Now at any time you can become un-acne-bit with a last lousy point which is a bit of a brand name, but it's a relatively common one.
















































store f

> forest
> in

Note: the puzzles are random here. You have two of the four cardinal directions to go, and there's no penalty for a wrong way. So you could just plain guess. You can probably figure out which way without a mistake, though. Also, you won't get the same way twice.

> (direction)
> (direction)

Now you're out of the forest. You need to sort of look like the spirits passing through in the line of no life.

> e
> nose
> shades
> shotgun
> put shades on nose

Okay, that's all you can do in the east. But your disguise isn't complete, yet. What about to the west?

> w
> w
> maps
> beard
> put nose on beard
> wear beard
> e
> n
> chisel
> get chisel

The banshee can be disposed of and made a thing of the past for a last lousy point.

> hasbeen

> s
> w
> peel chicken
> peel cow
> put chicken in canister
> put cow in canister
> e
> n
> sliver
> drapes
> cut drapes
> silver
> put silver in gun
> n
> read maps
> wolves
> shoot wolves

















































store i

> scan store i
> read store i
> sortie
> d
> sixteen
> n
> kitchen
> tortilla
> lettuce
> steak
> parmesan
> hotsauce
> put hotsauce in tortilla
> put steak on tortilla
> put lettuce on tortilla
> put parmesan on tortilla
> coat
> e
> s
> sack
> shoes
> straw
> put straw in sack
> moor
> attack poet

Okay, not really. He's just kind of annoying. If you wait around, you'll get another clue, but...

> peasant
> give straw
> room
> n
> put hay in wall
> hallway
> e
> cask
> fill cask

You can teleport back to the moor from anywhere. The game gives you that shortcut.

> moor
> soil
> room
> n
> e
> fill cask
> w

The way east collapses. You have all you need.

> moor
> silo
> missile
> black door
> fold doggerel
> throw plane

(A clue, sort of.)

> panel
> put panel on silo
> put black door on silo
> put missile in silo
> shoot
> steer
> push steer
> push shoot













































store m (the alternate way through is in parentheses)

> metros
> enter metros
> gardenia
> n
> w
> tomato
> e
> s
> w
> throw tomato at night thing
> search mattress
> e
> n
> n
> switch emitter
> keycard

Oh, those antlers are actually ridiculously expensive and ostentatious.

> rentals

> s
> e
> give gardenia to faeries
> get brocade
> get heaths/get begonias

And now the walkthrough splits in two.

> w
> w
> sheath/noise bag
> sword/open bag
> barcode
> put barcode on keycard
> e
> controls
> velcro
> wear velcro
> show emitter to deadbeat

(Optional, but it allows another way to get rid of the nerds.)

> s
> e
> ask nerds about darkness/switch emitter/open noise bag
> w
> s
> climb wall
> opening
> put controls in opening
> d
> e
> resin
> beast
> sword (get sword, if you have the sheath)
> attack beast

















































store r (again, there are two ways through. Well, four, technically. Okay, technically, twelve, if you leave some puzzles undone.)

> resort
> enter resort
> islet
> wings

And, for full points, also knock off

> cork

> e
> slope
> e

Not quite, yet.

> ropes
> grips (the toolshed can be changed instead of, or in addition to, both of these)
> e
> trio
> potters

To get a Last Lousy Point,

> china

> kilns
> tug toe
> e
> exist





I hope you enjoyed this game!

Note: if you want to replay but skip a section, here are some cheats.

LOGOI skips the forest. (An IGLOO is in Frost Forst.)
SOOTH skips the sortie.
SAY BS skips the metros.
