Walkthrough for Shuffling Around, an IFComp 2012 game by Andrew Schultz (schultz.andrew@sbcglobal.net) as Ned Yompus

Last updated 4/11/2017 for release 5. The different ways through have been tested to work. The game branches a bit near the end, and I try to cover all these things.

I put in a lot of spaces so as not to spoil things. There are three sections you can complete in any order, in the middle of the game, before store r. For IFComp, you only had to complete two. For this, you can complete all three, or you can activate the RECUSE button to get all two.

You may wish to search for the following: intro, store f, store i, store m, store r.

*********** intro

> in

Now for your first puzzle. The odor can be shifted around a bit.

> door

This is the main mechanic of the game: it's guess-the-noun more than guess-the-verb, though the noun is just an anagram of what's there.

> x door

You'll notice there are two odd parts to the door. Either can be dealt with.

Examining items is never needed to complete Shuffling Around, but I try to give clues for people who examine stuff. As the walkthrough goes on, I'll skip these intermediary steps and just give the commands to use.

> x bolt
> x bulge

In either of these door components, you just need to shift two letters to make something new. Let's fix (or destroy) the bolt.

> blot

You can also change the bulge. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. If you change both the bugle and bolt, that's one of the three bonus points in the intro.

> in

> goat

Now you can just walk right in! But you have a bonus point that I hope is not very hard.

The sent nets are making a bit of a mess here. They are too stuck in the ground to take, but you can change them if you want to be a good citizen!

> x nets

TENS of them. Hmm.

> nest

There's a bonus point.

> in

> gateman
> x cabinet (this & next bit before entering gate optional but recommended)
> take all (Oops! Can't take dollhouse)
> scan dollhouse

(You have all you need now, but you may want to get this information.)

> read board
> read info-lit
> ask about mumblety-peg
> ask about cabinet
> ask about quest
> ask about general advice
> ask about goat
> ask about redness
> ask about saltine
> ask about gadget
> ask about red bull burdell
> ask about redness
> get phial

Now, while you can enter the gateway right now you have one more bonus point available. You may wish to use the gadget on a certain item that will help you practice and see what calculations you need to make.

> static

> certify static

This tells you which letters are in the right position! In this case, the T in slot 2 is the only green light. Note you may get no positives. It will happen 40% of the time (well, assuming anagram shuffling is fully random and if a word has no repeated letters--if not, it happens less.) Note there are synonyms that are easier to type.

> cert static
> cer static
> c static

But wait! There's another mode! RECTIFY tells you the first and last letters. This is potentially very handy, and yes, you can combine the two if you want. Down the road, you will have a choice to make: be able to use both options, or be able to skip an area? But for introductory puzzles, you can use both without any penalty.

> rectify static
> rect static
> rec static
> r static

The green is in slot 3, with the red in slot 2. That means you have A----S.

Coupled with the above, that's AT---S. If we remember the "certify" logic, position 4 can't be T, and position 5 can't be I. This leaves 3 possibilities for words, depending on what position 3 is.

ATCITS
ATICTS
ATTICS

You can guess which is right!

Oh. One other thing.

> rc static

Will show you everything at once.

> attics

Now you can RECTIFY or CERTIFY again just to get a taste for how things work.

> getaway

> enter gate

At any time you can become un-acne-bit with a last lousy point which is a bit of a brand name, but it's a relatively common one.
















































store f

> forest
> in

Note: the puzzles are random here. You have two of the four cardinal directions to go, and there's no penalty for a wrong way. So you could just plain guess. You will sense something, and it is a clue for the right way to go. Also, you won't get the same way twice.

A shout means south.
Stew means west.
Teas means east.
Thorn means north.

> (direction)
> (direction)

Now you're out of the forest. You need to sort of look like the spirits passing through in the line of no life. They all have something in common. You'll need some sort of disguise.

> e
> nose
> shades
> shotgun
> put shades on nose

Okay, that's all you can do in Gnarliest Triangles. But your disguise isn't complete, yet. What about to the west?

> w
> w
> maps
> beard
> put nose on beard
> wear beard

Okay, you've got your disguise! You'll have to come back to Flesh Shelf later, because the grinder will help you.

> e
> n
> chisel
> get chisel

The banshee can be disposed of and made a thing of the past for a last lousy point.

> hasbeen

> s
> w

The two types of liver are functionally identical. You can also say "river" or "ville" for the RiverVille liver to save keystrokes.

> peel riverville
> peel viler
> put viler in canister
> put riverville in canister

Now that you've made livers, you have what you need to go past the Emptiness Sepiments.

> e
> n
> sliver
> drapes
> cut drapes
> silver
> put silver in gun
> n

Oh no! That doesn't quite work! We get lost! Wait, we have something that helps us not get lost.

> read maps

> wolves

You can actually waste time and get killed here, but I think you know what to do.

> shoot wolves

















































STORE I

> scan store i
> read store i
> sortie

> in

(You can also ENTER DESPOT DEPOTS, but that's a bit longer to type.)

Now you have a puzzle. What number do you need to change the dial to? It can be a binary search, or ... it can be a number. A number containing E, I, S, T and X. And any of NSEW.

> sixteen

> n

You're abducted here to THE NICK. You're hungry for a way out.

> kitchen

The Dinner Rendin' Red Inn has stuff you need to change.

> tortilla
> lettuce
> steak
> parmesan
> hotsauce

Now non-anagram stuff.

> put hotsauce in tortilla
> put steak on tortilla
> put lettuce on tortilla
> put parmesan on tortilla

What can we do with a taco?

> coat

This will keep us warm once we leave this small area. But we haven't visited everywhere yet.

In fact, we've missed a couple bonus points.

> x fridge

If you look in the Grief'd Fridge, you can whip up some food. First, the grist can become something more edible.

> grits

And the cake pan can be, uh, flipped.

> pancake

The kitchen is now no longer useful to you.

> e
> s

Now we have a container we'll switch back and forth.

> sack

What good are hoses? Not much, in their current form.

> shoes
> straw
> put straw in sack

Okay, we're prepared for the next bit.

> moor
> attack poet

Okay, not really. He's just kind of annoying. If you wait around, you'll get another clue, but...

> peasant
> give straw

Now you can just get back the opposite of how you came.

> room
> n

We haven't done anything in Stiller Trellis yet.

> put hay in wall
> hallway
> e
> cask
> fill cask

You can teleport back to the moor from anywhere. The game gives you that shortcut.

> moor

Oils aren't useful here, but maybe something else is.

> soil

Maybe there's something else the cask can do!

> room
> n
> e
> fill cask
> w

The way east collapses, but don't worry. You have all you need.

> moor
> silo

Oh wow! But now what to do with the smilies in the poem?

> missile

The roadblock can help you push through a roadblock in the game.

> black door
> fold doggerel

> throw plane

A clue, sort of. What can it become?

> panel

The silo seems bare. You need to jazz it up a bit with what you've found.

> put panel on silo
> put black door on silo
> put missile in silo

Now the panel has two buttons: HOOTS and TREES. That's all very nature-worthy, but you need something a bit more aggressive. There's no punishment for figuring or pushing them in the wrong order.

> shoot
> steer

> push steer
> push shoot

Hooray! You've solved the sortie.














































Store M (note you have more than one way through. I've used a slash to determine when alternate commands work, once things split off.)

> metros
> enter metros

We can clean up the drainage a bit at first!

> gardenia

The Ol' Hotel has a night thing in it. The ketchup bottle it has destroyed is a clue.

> n
> w

A MOTTO seems a bit forced. But we can get something from it.

> tomato
> e
> s
> w
> throw tomato at night thing

Wow, that grossed the night thing out! Let's see what it was guarding.

> search mattress

A termite emitter! Is there anywhere that could use a drop in property values? Yes, yes there is.

> e
> n
> n
> switch emitter
> keycard

The keycard will come in handy later, but it's still not functional, yet.

Now for a bonus point. Those antlers are actually ridiculously expensive and ostentatious looking.

> rentals

> s
> e
> give gardenia to faeries
> get brocade

And now the walkthrough splits in two. You may wish to save here if you want to try both paths.

> get heaths/get begonias

> w
> w
> sheath/noise bag
> sword/open bag

The brocade isn't useful as-is, but it's a bit odd. Black and white?

> barcode
> put barcode on keycard

> e

The lost corn seems odd.

> controls

The clover may bring you good luck--but you have to make your own luck.

> velcro
> wear velcro

The below is optional but provides a quick alternate solution:

> show emitter to deadbeat

> s

The keycard now works automatically!

> e

Take your pick of how to solve things. If you got the heaths, the third option is not possible.

> ask nerds about darkness/switch emitter/open noise bag

> w
> s

There's something wrong with the neon pig at the Tramline Terminal. Let's get rid of it.

> climb wall
> opening

What could go in the opening?

> put controls in opening
> d

You have what you need to face the beats.

> e
> resin

The beats are too incorporeal. You need something physical to attack, even if it's a bit scary.

> beast
> sword/get sword

> attack beast

Metros down. Yay! If you've gone in order, the final area is now available.


















































Store R (again, there are multiple ways through. This covers them all.)

> resort
> enter resort

The Astral Altars seem to be a "yay, good end" place. But you have not beaten Red Bull Burdell yet. So something is wrong here. You need a way out.

> islet

Not quite an islet, but a Leis Isle. Again, something is wrong here, as if you'd already finished things! But you haven't. You can react to the Leis Isle for a bonus point.

> lies

Whether you do that or not, you need a way out. There are two. Getting both gets an extra point. They are functionally equivalent, though one saves keystrokes.

The rock can't help you across water as-is.

> cork

Neither can the swing.

> wings

> e

Now the poles blocking your way can become more climbable and less vertical.

> slope

> e

Not quite, yet. There's material around to collect. You need to make two five-letter matches or one eight-letter match to go further east. The five-letter ones may be easier in-game, but the eight-letter one requires fewer keystrokes.

The spore and the grips can become something new.

> ropes
> grips

Now you can just go east, but the toolshed can be changed to something more practical. Well, practical for you, right now.

> toeholds

> e

Oh no! Too many people protesting you!

> trio

The protest needs something better to do than protest. Maybe an artistic interest.

> potters

The chain links have two pieces. You only need to change one. If you change the "right" one first, you don't get a bonus point. So, to get a Last Lousy Point,

> china

To make the potters happy:

> kilns

Oh no, again! Red Bull Burdell, finally! He pushes you down, then yells GET OUT a lot! It means something. Examine him, and he has a weakness. Holey footwear.

> tug toe

> e

Now there are three ways through at the end. The EXITS, or ... well, it's a Means Manse. It's pretty empty, but it has possibilities.

> exist

You can do something to make your new home feel homier. Start labeling everything and giving them roles.

> names

Or you can also close the book (books?) in another way.

> amens

There's very little difference between the three endings, but you can UNDO to retry them all.

I hope you enjoyed this game! The sequel, A Roiling Original, really beats the concept to death.

Note: if you want to replay but skip a section, here are some cheats.

LOGOI skips the forest. (An IGLOO is in Frost Forst.)
SOOTH skips the sortie. (A riff on the HOOTS button.)
SAY BS skips the metros. (A riff on BASSY ABYSS.)
