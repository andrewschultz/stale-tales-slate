>INTRODUCTION (ORDEAL LOADER)
?What is my power in this game?
Does the name of this opening room strike you as curious?
Spoiler below, though you can guess.
They're anagrams.
That is your power in the game.
>>BUSIEST SUBSITE
?Where do I go, to start?
None of the standard directions work.
The passage seems to be calling you.
You can ENTER the passage or go IN.
?What's with all the scenery?
It's a clue as to the game's mechanic.
Less stuffily, you'll notice a lot of silly word tricks.
They clue your power.
The name list should make it obvious.
?What's with the name list?
All the names have something in common you (probably) don't have.
There are 400+, so you don't need to look through all of them.
All the first and last names make anagrams.
>>RESTED DESERT
?What's the odor?
It can become something more physical.
Just switch two letters.
Make it a DOOR.
?Can I do anything with the bolt?
Yes, again, switching two letters.
It can become a BLOT, unlocking the door.
You can enter the door after this, though you won't get maximum points.
?Can I do anything with the bulge?
Yes, again, switching two letters.
It can become a BUGLE.
You can PLAY the BUGLE to unlock the door.
You can enter the door after this, though you won't get maximum points.
>>THICKEST THICKETS
?What's the toga doing here?
Nothing. It is your first "real" test.
You only switched two letters before, but this is a step up.
'You GOT A believe' seems forced. On purpose.
You may also notice that the toga smells of a barnyard.
And flipping any two letters doesn't do too much.
That is because it should be a GOAT.
Once you've made the goat, just go IN.
?Is there anything else to do here?
Well, nothing game-critical.
The darnels are snarled, and they make you want to lash out verbally.
This is a seven-letter puzzle and, thus, maybe a bit tough for early on. And you have no cluing device.
You can SLANDER the snarled darnels for an extra point.
>>NOTICES SECTION
?Do I need to do anything with the getaway gateway?
No. You need someone to operate it.
If you read the broad board, you'll see that the nametag may be something else.
You'll also read some cues about red letters.
?How do I get someone to help me?
Well, there are a few clues.
The broad board indicates you need to do something with the magenta nametag.
The mega-ant is all red. So it is all wrong, as the board says: seeing red means you're seeing things all wrong.
Other clues include Mt. Egana, red again.
You can place the A's with one more clue, in particular, A TAN GEM won't help you, and it should be a lot easier.
-A---A-. Tengama (from the nametag,) Mt. Egana and E.g, man ta! (Ta meaning goodbye) cut things down even more.
GATEMAN. With or without the space.
?What do I talk to the gateman about?
It's useful to ask about the tagged gadget, so you can take it from the cabinet.
He has some advice, like about the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. The numbers aren't important, and it duplicates what's on the broad board, but hey.
?What does CERTIFY/RECTIFY do?
RECTIFY may give no letters. CERTIFY gives two.
You can try both of them if you want.
?What does RECUSE/SECURE do?
RECUSE lets you skip an area. You can use only one of CERTIFY/RECTIFY once you set it.
SECURE lets you use both of CERTIFY/RECTIFY.
This is set for good once you leave the next room.
?Which gadget setting is best?
RECTIFY will give you one letter right on average. CERTIFY gives two.
So CERTIFY makes the game easier, but RECTIFY may get you certain puzzles.
Sometimes there'll be red clues telling you what's wrong. Those can add to either.
?Is the dollhouse critical?
No, but it gives you a Last Lousy Point.
The static can be changed.
You should use the gadget in both orientations.
It gives you another example puzzle.
AT---S are what you change the static to.
There are actually only four possibilities left. You can brute force this.
You can flip the ATTICS back, too, to get comfortable with the gadget.
>STORES
>>TRIPS STRIP
?Oh no! I broke my leg and now it's in a cast! Plus I'm lonely.
You could use some companionship.
If only there was a way to change the cast.
Wait! It can be!
Into cats.
You can even choose what color they are...
...since you've already imagined the cast and cats anyway.
?Can I do anything with the stores?
Yes. F, I, M and later R.
Look at them for clues.
?Store F?
Green and brown, earth tones.
FOREST.
?Store I?
It's an exit.
The writing gives some ideas as well.
You can flip the gadget to get four letters, which makes the remaining two trivial.
SORTIE.
?Store M?
Mt. Rose gives a clue.
METROS.
?Store R?
You can't do anything with it right away.
It can become a RESORT once you've solved two stores--three if you SECUREd the gadget.
?The cabinet is back! Can I do anything with/to it?
It's a sort of obscure last point.
It could be an animal. A nice one.
Specifically, a NICE BAT.
>STORE F
>>SOFTER FOREST
?How do I go anywhere?
There'll be some scenery, or something you notice.
You can use that to determine what direction to go. It's random in each play-through.
Or you can just find your way by accident. This wasn't intended to be a tough puzzle.
If you smell stew, go WEST. Teas, go EAST. If you hear a shout, go SOUTH. If you see a thorn, go NORTH.
After the Softer Forest, there's one more room with a similar plan.
>>REST OF FOREST
?Is this different from the softer forest?
Well, you won't get the same direction twice.
But the same logic applies.
There'll be something else random that tells you what direction to go.
>>Self-ID Fields
?How do I get through Corses Crosse?
You need a disguise.
Facial hair, glasses and nose.
They're in the side areas.
PUT SHADES ON NOSE
PUT NOSE ON BEARD
WEAR DISGUISE.N
>>Gnarliest Triangles
?What do I do with the ones?
They become a NOSE.
?What do I do with the noughts?
They become a SHOTGUN.
?What do I do with the dashes?
They become SHADES.
>>Flesh Shelf
?What are the iciest cities for?
They're just there to make it more believable it's frozen in here.
?Is there a difference between the two livers?
Cosmetically, yes.
Functionally, no.
?What do I do with the grinder?
You need to put each liver in it.
With the product, the livers...
...you make a SLIVER.
?What do I do with the sandwich?
OPEN it and it's bread and spam.
?What do I do with the sandwich components?
The bread looks scuzzy.
It becomes a BEARD.
The spam has weird lines.
Because it can be MAPS.
>>CRUEL ONES' ENCLOSURE
?The liches are scary! What do I do?
Look at them. They may clue a word.
They become a CHISEL.
Now you can go back to the Storing Area and chisel the livers.
?What do I do with the drapes?
None will be spared.
SPREAD.
CUT SPREAD (with sliver)
?That banshee is annoying! Can I get rid of it?
It's a last lousy point, but yes.
I'll put in a buffer here before spoiling it.
HASBEEN or HAS BEEN.
?Do I need anything for the next bit?
Yes. The maps...
...the silver...
...and the shotgun.
>>Ghouls' Slough
?How do I not get lost?
READ MAPS.
?How do I get a loaded weapon?
You should have the shotgun from Sorting.
You need some ammo that will repel wolves.
SILVER.
PUT SILVER IN SHOTGUN.
>>Frost Forts
?Vowels? Words can't hurt me, can they?
Well, apparently one would flow.
WOLVES.
?How do I shoot the enemies?
SHOOT WOLVES.
>STORE I
>>TRAP PART
?How do I stop the spinning?
Two ways. You can guess, using binary searches.
Or you can note EXITS?? =~ some number.
It must have an X, and two of (NSEW).
SIXTEEN.
?The room name changed! Does this mean anything?
Only that there's not much else to do here.
>>THE NICK
?Oh no! How do I get out?
There's graffiti, etc., all around that points to an anagram with CEHIKNT.
You hungry for a new location?
KITCHEN.
>>AFTER ESCAPING THE NICK
?What do I do here in the Kitchen?
You need to make something warm.
The ingredients are on the counter.
You can PUT them on each other once they're made.
?What's the spearman?
Cheesy.
A cheese is...
PARMESAN.
?What's the skate for?
Meaty.
STEAK.
?What's the tall trio for?
Doughy...
TORTILLA.
>>>In the fridge
?What's the cakepan?
An optional point, and an easy one, I hope.
PANCAKE.
?What's the grist?
An optional point, and an easy one, I hope.
GRITS.
?Help! I have warts!
Reverse them.
They can become STRAW.
You can get a container later.
>>Room
?Who is this long haired guy with the shades and the accent I can't quite place?
Is this question TEARING YOU APART?
He's Tommy Wiseau, the writer, producer and lead actor in <i>The Room</i>.
Wait, no he isn't. He's not in this game at all. But he IS in <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/547307">this one</a>.
I know, I know, I should've left my STUPID joke clues in my pocket.
?What are the rubber hoses for?
You notice your feet getting wet?
They can become SHOES.
?What is the cask for?
Carrying stuff.
But not everything.
Some stuff requires a SACK.
You can switch back and forth.
The straw from the warts fits in the sack, for now.
?Where can I go from here?
Your gadget registers something.
And, well, apparently you can get to the flipside.
What do you get when you flip ROOM?
MOOR.
>>Stiller Trellis
?Can I go east?
Yes, but not right away. You need to find a third way out of the Room.
HALLWAY under construction.
4/7 complete with a WALL. ??
You have a wall. It needs to be filled with something.
HALLWAY-WALL=HAY.
Once you have hay, PUT HAY IN WALL
Then, HALLWAY.
?Help! The location name changed!
That's because you're done to the east.
>>BEYOND THE ROOM
?How do I get rid of the poet?
Everything is in ANAPEST.
ST. PAEAN is his latest work.
Summoning a PEASANT will get him to flee.
?What do I do for the peasant?
He has hay, but Mean Old Mondale-Doleman doesn't know the difference between that and straw. Or pretends not to.
Warp to the room if need be. PUT STRAW IN SACK.TAKE SACK. GIVE STRAW TO PEASANT.
Woohoo! Some hay! And another poem. A shorter one.
?What do I do with the poem?
It looks like you can fold it, but wait. The smilies cry out.
The smilies can become a MISSILE. Don't worry. It's nonviolent.
Then when you FOLD THE PAPER, it becomes a plane.
Which can become a PANEL.
?What do I do or build in the moor?
You need to build something to house the missile.
Sacred Cedars, east of the Stiller Trellis, has more information. It talks about a weapon and such but really you just need the oils. So don't reveal any more clues until you've been there.
SILO won't work. Not a firm foundation, the muck.
SOIL.
Go back for more oils.
SILO.
?Okay, I built something. What to put on it?
See the poem clue.
The panel is a good start.
PUT PANEL ON SILO.
?What's this roadblock?
It looks like it should lead somewhere.
The silo also has the outline of a door--but it doesn't have a door.
????? DOOR.
BLACK DOOR.
?What else can I do to get the weapon working?
PUT DOOR ON SILO.
PUT MISSILE IN SILO.
?What do I push on the panel?
HOOTS and TREES don't do much.
What do you do with a missile?
SHOOT it. But you cannot do so for safety reasons. It's inaccurate.
What can TREES do? Not RESET, but...
STEER. So...
STEER
PUSH STEER
SHOOT
PUSH SHOOT
>>Sacred Cedars
?Who is Lois?
She'll provide you with something that can be transformed.
OILS.
?How do I get the oils?
The sack leaks.
But it can turn back...
...into a CASK.
PUT OILS IN CASK.
You'll need to do so twice.
?Help! Stiller Trellis changed its name!
That was just something I put in there to make it clear players didn't need to visit Sacred Cedars again.
Also, I thought it was a cool room name, but adding a room seemed like a bad idea. Like the Centrifuge, it's just a way to say you're done here.
>STORE M
>>Undesired Underside
?What do I do with the drainage?
It would be the first thing to beautify.
The Aged Rain is a clue. So is Dear Inga, or the Arena Dig.
In addition, A Reading makes you see red.
The flower shop may want this item, as it's a...
GARDENIA.
?Can I go east? How?
Yes. It's probably the big puzzle for this section.
You need an ID. It's built from items from two other places.
One thing is from the Obtains Boastin Bastion. The other is from Fo' Real Florae.
Spoilers of what to change things to are ahead.
The KEYCARD and BARCODE.
PUT BARCODE ON KEYCARD.
PUT KEYCARD ON SENSOR.
>>Roarings Garrison
?What do I do with the clover?
It has hooks...
...like VELCRO.
?What does the deadbeat want?
For you to stick it to the man to the north.
Once you do, he will let you have the lost corn.
?Can I do anything else with the deadbeat?
Yes, but you don't have to.
If you give him the emitter, he fills it with angst gnats.
?What does the lost corn become?
It's from SlorntCo, and it looks high-tech.
CONTROLS.
>>BILE LIBE
?What do I do with a motto?
It is a motto, not the motto, after all. It advertises itself as such.
TOMATO.
?What do I do with the words?
You need to have done business with the fairies.
Then, it depends whether you got the heaths or begonias.
The heaths become a SHEATH.
Then you can make the words a SWORD.
Alternatively the begonias become a NOISE BAG.
OPEN NOISE BAG.
>>The Ol' Hotel
?Can I look at the mattress?
Not til the night thing's gone.
Once you do, you get a termite emitter.
It's useful to lower property values.
?What do I do with the Night Thing?
The bottle of ketchup is a clue.
THROW TOMATO AT THING.
>>OBTAINS BOASTIN' BASTION
?Do I need the dry cake?
Yes, but you need to get rid of people.
?Can I go anywhere else?
No. The exits are all blocked.
?What do I need to do here to get people to leave?
Have you gotten anything from the ol' hotel?
Have you searched the mattress, once the Night Thing is gone?
The termite emitter might be handy.
SWITCH EMITTER.
GET CAKE before you leave. Well, the game forces you to. I hope.
?What should the dry cake be?
Oddly metallic.
KEYCARD.
?What are the antlers for?
Pretentious. Presumptuous. Far too expensive to own.
But not critical to the game.
They are RENTALS.
>>Fo' Real Florae
?What do the faeries want?
A flower.
There's one in the Underside.
The GARDENIA.
GIVE GARDENIA TO FAERIES.
Take either the heaths or begonias.
Note that the flowers look sort of like containers.
?What is the brocade for?
It's got black vertical lines on white background.
A lot like a sort of ID...
...a BARCODE.
?What do I do to the heaths?
They can become a SHEATH.
?What do I do to the begonias?
They become a NOISE BAG.
>>Anti-Cool Location
?Is the lit-up tulip important?
Yes. But you need to show the nerds you're smart enough.
?How do I deal with the nerds?
Three ways. One, ASK NERDS about the right thing.
They give hints. What is a lit-up tulip for?
To provide light in the...
...DARKNESS.
You can also OPEN THE NOISE BAG if you have it, since the nerds are in a quiet environment apart from the city.
You can also SWITCH THE EMITTER if you have the angst gnats.
They kick you out, but you're done here now.
>>Elm Train Terminal
?Can I go east? How?
You need a light source and to make the way less dangerous.
The light source is in the Anti-Cool Location, east of the Underside.
You also need to shut down the faulty electricity to the east.
?What's this neon pig?
So tacky, better to have nothing there at all.
Or, at least, an OPENING.
?Can I reach where the pig was?
Yes.
WEAR VELCRO. CLIMB WALL.
?What do I do when I'm up there?
PUT CONTROLS IN OPENING.
Now the rail is working again!
>>Bassy Abyss
?Stupid siren!
You can't RINSE...
...and you can't pound it into dust...
...but it can be RESIN.
?The beats are annoying me! How can I fight them?
They're nasty, but not physical enough.
However, a BEAST would be.
?I can't grab my sword from the sheath!
See siren above.
?Can I use the noise bag?
OPEN BAG.SWORD
?How do I kill the enemy?
ATTACK BEAST.
>STORE R
>>Astral Altars
?What? This is one lousy resort!
Wait, you have a STILE, and you have TILES.
They can become something else.
An ISLET.
>>Leis Isle
?Is this paradise? What do I do with the leis?
No, it's not paradise. If you try to do anything with them they become, well...
...LIES. However, there are other items on the island.
?How do I get out of here?
The rock or the swing can be used. They're functionally equivalent.
You can flip the other one to get an extra point.
If you leave before doing so, you can't get maximum points. If that's interesting to you.
?What does the rock become?
It says FLOAT.
What floats?
CORK.
?What does the swing become?
It says ALOFT.
What flies?
WINGS.
>>Rived Drive
?The poles are too steep!
Yes, they're vertical.
What can be at an angle?
A SLOPE.
But now you still need help to climb it.
?What do I need to change, here?
The poles...
...and either the toolshed, or the sprig and spore.
You can change both for an extra two points.
?Can the sprig become anything?
Yes. It's a bit sticky as is.
GRIPS.
?Can the spore become anything?
It seems flexible, but what's even more flexible?
ROPES.
?What's the toolshed do?
It can become something pretty slick.
TOEHOLDS.
?When can I go up?
When you've transformed the poles, and either the toolshed...
...or both the grips and ropes.
>>Potshot Hotspot
?What can I do with the ransom manors?
Nothing, until you've defeated Red Bull Burdell.
?This riot sure has a lot of people!
It would be easier to handle if there were under ten.
Under five, hey.
Maybe even three.
TRIO.
?Help! They're still a protest!
They need something better to do with their hands.
Maybe if they were POTTERS.
?What can I do with the links?
The potters have no tools!
What do all potters need?
KILNS.
Or, if you want that last lousy point...
...you can change the CHAIN to CHINA, before changing the links.
?Oh no! It's Red Bull Burdell! How do I beat him?
Don't worry. He won't beat you.
What does he say every move?
GET OUT!
Look at him. Does he have a weakness?
Hm, his foot.
Specifically, his toe.
TUG TOE.
>>Means Manse
?What do I do with the exits?
There are exits on all side, but you don't want to take them.
You deserve to sit, relax and do nothing.
Your gadget should give a clue either way.
Just EXIST.
?Can I do anything with anything else?
Yes, the manse itself.
What can MEANS or MANSE become?
Two things.
You can start finding NAMES for everything.
Or you can give AMENS.
>General
#roomlevel=4
>>Last lousy points?
?Do I get anything special for getting the last lousy points?
No, and if you want to see what happens, you can just search for the source (in quotes) in story.ni.
?Where are they distributed?
There's three at the start.
There's one in the stores area.
There's one in Store F.
There're two in Store I.
There's one in Store M.
There're five in Store R, though one is potentially two points.
?Where are the LLPs in the Ordeal Loader?
You can do two things with the odor/door. You only need to do one to get by.
BUGLE and BOLT both.
The snarled darnels can't become anything, but you can be mad at them.
They won't sue you if you ...
SLANDER them.
The static is also changeable.
It can become ATTICS.
?What do we do with the cabinet?
You need something that you can pour onto it.
This is a name brand that's become a common accepted word, much like the clover.
BACTINE.
?Where are the LLPs in the forest?
Well, there's only one.
In the Cruel One's Enclosure, you can deal with the banshee.
Put it in the past tense.
Make it a HAS-BEEN.
?Where are the LLPs in the sortie?
They are both in the grief'd fridge.
The cake pan may be especially easy.
It becomes a PANCAKE.
The grist doesn't need many changes either.
It becomes GRITS.
?Where are the LLPs in the metros?
There is just one.
It's in the Bastion.
The antlers don't have to stay there...
...if you change them to RENTALS.
?Where are the LLPs in the resort?
There are a few.
The first is in Leis Isle.
Before examining anything, you should say LIES.
Then getting both the CORK and WINGS will get you another.
You get up to two points for changing all of the TOOLSHED, GRIPS and SLOPE.
Finally, you can change the chain links to CHINA before turning them into kilns.
?Can we get locked out of any LLPs?
If you solve an area, yes.
Moving on from the desert or thickets loses a maximum point in the Ordeal Loader.
Moving on from the Cruel Ones' Enclosure loses the bonus point in Store F.
The LLPs in the fridge are always available in Store I.
If you clear the Bastion without dealing with the antlers, you lose a maximum point in Store M.
Moving on from the isle or drive loses a point in store R. In addition, you lose a chance for an LLP in your current location if you take the leis or flip the kilns first.
