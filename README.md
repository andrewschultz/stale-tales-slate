Source and binaries for Shuffling Around and A Roiling Original, two text adventures with similar themes. You may guess by the titles.

They were conceived in March of 2012. Shuffling Around was written for the 2012 IFComp (9/29/2012) and Roiling for Spring Thing (4/1/2013). Since then they have gone through several revisions.

firsts.txt and lasts.txt compiled with the help of mongabay.com.

I forgot where I got brit-1word from.

All other programs should compile with PERL.

Inform files are compiled with 6G95.

Shuffling Around cover art is copyright Wade Clarke.

All PERL files should run with any version of PERL. There should be little need for extension. I make no claims for readability.
