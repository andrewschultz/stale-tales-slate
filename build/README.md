Building isn't really recommended, and I can't give much technical help, but I wanted to try to get this out there.

I used the Inform 6G60 version of the Windows IDE to do so. It implicitly uses version 2/090402 by Graham Nelson.

Full assembly of header files is left to the reader.

# my stuff first

Anything labeled "STS *.i7x" should be in the top directory.

Anything starting with a game name should be in that game's base directory, e.g.

* https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/tree/main/Roiling
* https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/tree/main/Shuffling
* https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/tree/main/Torus

Also, pull over https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/tree/main/STS*.i7x.

This should all go to an Andrew Schultz extension folder on your local computer, e.g. c:\Program Files (x86)\Inform 7\Inform7\Extensions\Andrew Schultz.
