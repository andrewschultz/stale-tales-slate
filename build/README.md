Building isn't really recommended, and I can't give much technical help, but I wanted to try to get this out there.

I used the Inform 6G60 version of the Windows IDE to do so. It implicitly uses version 2/090402 by Graham Nelson.

Full assembly of header files is left to the reader. They are presented in alphabetical order of names (first name first, not last name) and then extension name.

Special thanks to Dannii Willis for maintaining many of these libraries once the original authors relinquished them. Thanks to the original authors, too--I've come to learn even my own trivial libraries take time to keep up-to-date!

# my stuff first

Anything labeled "STS *.i7x" should be in the top directory.

Anything starting with a game name should be in that game's base directory, e.g.

* https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/tree/main/Roiling
* https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/tree/main/Shuffling
* https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/tree/main/Torus

Also, pull over https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/tree/main/STS*.i7x.

This should all go to an Andrew Schultz extension folder on your local computer, e.g. c:\Program Files (x86)\Inform 7\Inform7\Extensions\Andrew Schultz.
