A Roiling Original, release 4 notes

This was largely a maintenance release, spurred on by one bug Sean M. Shore found during testing of release 3. It was too complex to fix. Then one thing led to another, and so forth.

There are some items which give a hint what to do next. If you have used the hints, or if you've pre-figured things, those items may be used up with no real benefit.

There was also other miscellaneous stuff and even a few features that fell out when my mind wandered. I cheated and used a program to generate a lot, but I hope they're still fun.

--five new random lists
  --the Catechism now has a bunch of eminent Ph.D.s along with research topics and general information. (store P area)
  --Leo and Rand now have idols in fighting. (store P area)
  --a double: yes and no now have longer cycles of responses that you can see in the endgame. (general)
  --there are now random brands of sleepables if you examine the futon in the shack. (store P area)
--over two-thirds of the random lists now have 100+ entries. At last tally, it is 50.
--all random lists now have 25+ entries. Including the new yes and no responses.
--lists are cut off after ~30 responses, forcing you to win the game to see them all. Or go through the source code
--30000+ total elements in the random lists.
--I also decided to reveal the code names of the updates. They're rather silly, but I hope you enjoy them.
--last scan now appears/stays in header until solved
--you now have the ability to interpret gadget showings with PARSE or turn it off with SPARE
  --the game also tracks better if it is a complete spoiler, and the commands to check off are clearer
--VERB/VERBS and PAD VERBS now give general help
--all items have individual clues if you try to change them and you fail, and all items should give individual messages if they don't need to be changed

Store H:
--new fruits in the Field and Wells
--changed one puzzle to be a little less abstruse (green stain in Wells)
--the trader is now female if you are, with a new name

Store U:
--the scenery in the Same Mesa is now better-named

Store W:
--a few more clues for the Lone Duck
--the smart kid is now female if you are
--Dr. Yow is now female if you are
--the jetskis are replaced with a more appropriate conveyance

Store V:
--the Bedroom in Store V now has a new name

Store T:
--the macks' idiocy in Store T is now refactored to be drawn from seven pods (7/8 letters with or without repeating letters, 9, 10, and 12--which has one item,) much like the warriors in Store W. You still only need to figure only three, but I think this is less overwhelming

Meta-stuff:
--metrics HTML file updated with new solution
--tweaks to the Trizbort map

??Demo Dome Mode is now more robust
