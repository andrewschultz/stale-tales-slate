A Roiling Original, release 4 notes

This was largely a maintenance release, spurred on by one bug Sean M. Shore found during testing of release 3. It was too complex to fix. Then one thing led to another, and so forth.

There are some items which give a hint what to do next. If you have used the hints, or if you've pre-figured things, those items may be used up with no real benefit.

There was also other miscellaneous stuff and even a few features that fell out when my mind wandered. I cheated and used a program to generate a lot, but I hope they're still fun.

--five new random lists
  --the Catechism now has a bunch of eminent Ph.D.s along with research topics and general information. (store P area)
  --Leo and Rand now have idols in fighting. (store P area)
  --a double: yes and no now have longer cycles of responses that you can see in the endgame. (general)
  --there are now random brands of sleepables if you examine the futon in the shack. (store P area)
--over two-thirds of the random lists now have 100+ entries. At last tally, it is 50.
--all random lists now have 25+ entries. Including the new yes and no responses.
--lists are cut off after ~30 responses, forcing you to win the game to see them all. Or go through the source code
--30000+ total elements in the random lists.
--I also decided to reveal the code names of the updates. They're rather silly, but I hope you enjoy them.
--last scan now appears/stays in header until solved.
--you now have the ability to interpret gadget showings with PARSE or turn it off with SPARE.
  --the game also tracks better if it is a complete spoiler, and the commands to check off are clearer
--VERB/VERBS and PAD VERBS now give general help.
--all items have individual clues if you try to change them and you fail, and all items should give individual messages if they don't need to be changed.
--much more scenery is added, mostly to explain why you can't just go any old direction, but I hope the names amuse you.

Store H:
--new fruits in the Field and Wells.
--changed one puzzle to be a little less abstruse (green stain in Wells).
--the trader is now female if you are, with a new name.
--there's now the augural arugula that provides a clue if you GURU.

Store P:
--the volt maze now has a name: Nowt Town. This gives you an easy way through, but the original way is still viable and gets you an extra point. The final room of the maze also has a different name.
--the Phat Path is now Saps' Pass before you get rid of the baddies.

Store U:
--the scenery in the Same Mesa is now better-named.
--the Sun-Spared Underpass is still that, only the official name is Harms Marsh, full of Sheol Holes.
--Pat is now female if you are. /goes to watch Saturday Night Live.

Store W:
--a few more clues for the Lone Duck.
--the smart kid is now female if you are.
--Dr. Yow is now female if you are.
--the jetskis are replaced with a conveyance more appropriate to the game.
--the once-sad deacons have been replaced by gender-specific blockers.
--the man in the costume is replaced by a deal seer, male or female, gender specific too.
--the oddly rewired robot has been replaced by bluster butlers, but the robot's flip is now moved elsewhere for a Last Lousy Point.

Store V:
--there are now two more rooms in the sequence.
--FiefCo Office is renamed Upscale Capsule.

Store T:
--the macks' idiocy in Store T is now refactored to be drawn from seven pods (7/8 letters with or without repeating letters, 9, 10, and 12--which has one item,) much like the warriors in Store W. You still only need to figure only three, but I think this is less overwhelming.
--the Imp is now of indeterminate gender.
--the raw bulk bulwark is now the Edictal Citadel.

Store Y:
--the rude door is replaced with Span Pans.
--three rooms are renamed
  --Scum Ant Sanctum is Dourest Detours.
  --Collapsed Old Places is now Rascal Craals. Well, until you figure what to do in the Craals. Then they're seen as Collapsed Old Places you can't enter.
  --Uh at a Hut is now the Shadier Airshed, which makes it easier to fit all those items in there.
--there is a different thing to do near the end. Not a hard one, but a different one. It involves pins.

Meta-stuff:
--introductory region is renamed
--metrics HTML file updated with new solution
--tweaks to the Trizbort map

Demo Dome Mode is now much more robust, too.
