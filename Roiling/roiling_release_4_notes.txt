A Roiling Original, release 4 notes

This was largely a maintenance release, spurred on by one bug Sean M. Shore found during testing of release 3. It was too complex to fix. Then one thing led to another, and so forth.

There are some items which give a hint what to do next. If you have used the hints, or if you've pre-figured things, those items may be used up with no real benefit.

There was also other miscellaneous stuff and even a few features that fell out when my mind wandered. I cheated and used a program to generate a lot, but I hope they're still fun.

--five new random lists
  --the Catechism now has a bunch of eminent Ph.D.s along with research topics and general information. (P)
  --Leo and Rand now have idols in fighting. (P)
  --a double: yes and no now have longer cycles of responses that you can see in the endgame. (general)
  --there are now random brands of sleepables if you examine the futon in the shack. (P)
--over half of the random lists now have 100+ entries. Almost 60%, in fact: 43 of 72.
--all random lists now have 25+ entries. Including the new yes and no responses.
--30000+ total elements in the random lists.
--I also decided to reveal the code names of the updates. They're rather silly, but I hope you enjoy them.
--last scan now appears/stays in header until solved
--you now have the ability to interpret gadget showings with PARSE or turn it off with SPARE
--VERB/VERBS and PAD VERBS now give general help

Store H:
--changed one puzzle to be a little less abstruse (green stain in Wells)

Store U:
--the scenery in the Same Mesa is now better-named.

Store W:
--a few more clues for the Lone Duck
--the trader is now female if you are, with a new name
--the smart kid is now female if you are
--Dr. Yow is now female if you are
--the jetskis are replaced with a more appropriate conveyance

Store H:
--new fruits in the Field

Store V:
--the Bedroom in Store V now has a new name

Store T:
--the macks' idiocy in Store T is now refactored to be drawn from seven pods (7/8 duplicate/unduplicate, 9, 10, and 12--which has one item,) much like the warriors in Store W. You still only need to choose three, but I think this is less overwhelming

Meta-stuff:
--metrics HTML file updated with new solution
--tweaks to the Trizbort map

??Demo Dome Mode is now more robust
