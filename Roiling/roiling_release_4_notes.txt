A Roiling Original, release 4 notes

This was largely going to be a maintenance release, spurred on by one bug Sean M. Shore found during testing of release 3. It was too complex to fix. Then one thing led to another, and so forth, and I browsed my text file of anagrams just one more time...

There are some items which give a hint what to do next. If you have used the hints, or if you've pre-figured things, those items may be used up with no real benefit.

There was also other miscellaneous stuff and even a few features that fell out when my mind wandered. I cheated and used a program to generate a lot, but I hope they're still fun.

--bounding scenery is more prevalent and hopefully interesting.
--many items that need to be changed have double-anagram names.
--many rooms, once done, change names
--five new random lists
  --the Catechism now has a bunch of eminent Ph.D.s along with research topics and general information. (store P area)
  --Leo and Rand now have idols in fighting. (store P area)
  --a double: yes and no now have longer cycles of responses that you can see in the endgame. (general)
  --there are now random brands of sleepables if you examine the futon in the shack. (store P area)
--over two-thirds of the random lists now have 100+ entries. At last tally, it is 50.
--all random lists now have 25+ entries. Including the new yes and no responses.
--lists are cut off after ~30 responses, forcing you to win the game to see them all. Or go through the source code
--30000+ total elements in the random lists.
--I also decided to reveal the code names of the updates. They're rather silly, but I hope you enjoy them.
--last scan now appears/stays in header until solved.
--you now have the ability to interpret gadget showings with PARSE or turn it off with SPARE.
  --the game also tracks better if it is a complete spoiler, and the commands to check off are clearer
--VERB/VERBS and PAD VERBS now give general help.
--all items have individual clues if you try to change them and you fail, and all items should give individual messages if they don't need to be changed.
--much more scenery is added. While most of it is just boundaries to explain why you can't just go any old direction, there may be a Last Lousy Point in there, and I hope the names amuse you.
--there are some room name changes once you've done all you need to.

Means Manse (now Ordeal Reload):
--very silly LLP in the All-Grey Gallery.
--Respect Scepter is now an LLP that helps you test question marks.

Stores:
--smoke cloud renamed, as is the seating in Cruelest Lectures
--entries to each area are renamed more anagrammatically

Store H:
--new fruits in the Field and Wells.
--changed several puzzles to be a little less tough to guess the anagram (green stain in Wells).
--The melons/lemons puzzles are no longer duplicates of each other.
--the (bad guy) trader is now female if you are, with a new name. Len Craig is still in the Clangier Clearing.
--there's now the augural arugula that provides a clue if you GURU.
--the drinks stand is now ruts circuits.
--many fruits now have less obscure predecessors, e.g. omen prism, a brr hub, a banna', Prices Precis. There was some cleaning up of namespaces, too.

Store P:
--the volt maze now has a name: Nowt Town. This gives you an easy way through, one that's marginally in Store P's spirit, but it won't get you full points like original way does. The final room of the maze also has a different name.
--the Phat Path is now Saps' Pass before you get rid of the baddies. Char Arch is now south of Grey Gyre.
--a new Last Lousy Point in the Marines Seminar (renamed Marines Seminar Remains).
--censer has a brand name
--two new Last Lousy Points in the Hacks' Shack and one outside that signals the transitions betweebn types of words.

Store T:
--initial room is now no longer a puzzle. The barley is scenery, and the room's name changes.
--the macks' idiocy in Store T is now refactored to be drawn from seven pods (7 with or without repeating letters, 8 with or without repeating letters, 9, 10 or 11, and 12--which has one item,) much like the warriors in Store W. You still only need to figure only three, but I think this is less overwhelming.
--a new 11 letter clue which has enough repeated letters it's about as tough as the 10 letter clues.
--the Imp is now of indeterminate gender.
--the raw bulk bulwark is now the Edictal Citadel.
--the Wickeder Wire Deck is repurposed as bounding scenery, and the captive animal rooms are renamed AND change names when you've save enough of them.
--Rev. Howe is replaced by the Gore Ogre, but there is a spinoff LLP in the vow here.
--the final room now has a triple-anagram name.
--there are two LLPS to annoy Elmer and Merle with.

Store U:
--the scenery in the Same Mesa is now more thematically named.
--there is one more puzzle before the Morf Form appears.
--the Sun-Spared Underpass is still that, only the official name is Harms Marsh, full of Sheol Holes.
--Pat is now female if you are. /goes to watch Saturday Night Live.
--there is a new location, the Sonancy Canyons, with a new couple of final puzzles.

Store V:
--there are now two more rooms in the sequence.
--FiefCo Office is renamed Upscale Capsule. It has a new first puzzle and more silly random scenery that is labeled that way.
--Upscale Capsule now has a different ending puzzle, with Sister Tressi and Blamer Balmer watching you.
--last lousy point, a restaurant to ignore in Boarded Roadbed
--verb to enter the cellar is moved to Store P as a Last Lousy Point

Store W:
--Old Hat Daltho is now Ornate Atoner Renato. The flowerpot quest has more anagrams in general, and the recipient is differently-named.
--a few more clues for the Lone Duck.
--the smart kid is now female if you are. In fact, the smart kid isn't a smart kid any more, but a Coasting Agnostic, who requires slightly different help.

--The Muscly Hulk now mirrors your gender and has a name either way.
--the once-sad deacons have been replaced by gender-specific blockers as well.
--the jetskis are replaced with a conveyance more appropriate to the game: a boat. What kind of boat? Maybe you can guess.
--the man in the costume is replaced by a deal seer, male or female, gender specific too.
--the oddly rewired robot has been replaced by bluster butlers, but what to do with the robot is moved elsewhere and reversed for a Last Lousy Point.
--a fluster-self rut is now a guardian, with the ego drains shifting to an LLP.
--sporties' ripostes are an LLP replacing the neural pulses.
--rooms are shifted around, with more boundary scenery to make it believable you have to go back the way you came. There are a few new room names, such as Fringe Finger.
--the Obscurest Subsector is now more heavily guarded.
--Dourest Detours now appear if you visit a far-edge room.
--the smart kid is now a coasting agnostic, though this doesn't affect puzzles.

Store Y:
--the rude door is replaced with Span Pans.
--several rooms are renamed
  --Scum Ant Sanctum, the optional room near the end, is gone, replaced by an area accessible only by a Templar Ramplet.
  --Collapsed Old Places is now Rascal Craals. Well, until you figure what to do in the Craals. Then they're seen as Collapsed Old Places you can't enter.
  --Uh at a Hut is now the Shadier Airshed, which makes it easier to fit all those items in there.
  --Lean Lane is now where you find Tortu, and the old Lean Lane is renamed to Hardest Trashed Dearths.
--there is a different thing to do in the ending room. Not a hard one, but a different one. It involves pins.
--Hero's Shore is now Disease Seaside, and Anger Range changes its name to Hero's Shore once the haunter is gone.
