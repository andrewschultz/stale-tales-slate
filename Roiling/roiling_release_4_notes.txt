A Roiling Original, release 4 notes

This was largely a maintenance release, spurred on by one bug Sean M. Shore found during testing of release 3. It was too complex to fix. Then one thing led to another, and so forth.

There are some items which give a hint what to do next. If you have used the hints, or if you've pre-figured things, those items may be used up with no real benefit.

There was also other miscellaneous stuff and even a few features that fell out when my mind wandered. I cheated and used a program to generate a lot, but I hope they're still fun.

--five new random lists
  --the Catechism now has a bunch of eminent Ph.D.s along with research topics and general information. (P)
  --Leo and Rand now have idols in fighting. (P)
  --a double: yes and no now have longer cycles of responses that you can see in the endgame. (general)
  --there are now random brands of sleepables if you examine the futon in the shack. (P)
--over half of the random lists now have 100+ entries. Almost 60%, in fact: 43 of 72.
--all random lists now have 25+ entries. Including the new yes and no responses.
--30000+ total elements in the random lists.
--I also decided to reveal the code names of the updates. They're rather silly, but I hope you enjoy them.
