"A Roiling Original" by Andrew Schultz

volume browsing and building notes

[This initial section is to try and organize the source code. Of course, with 2.7 million+ bytes of source, it's sort of tough to figure where to start. I can't promise that my code is super-readable, but I hope you find it interesting. It's been vetted all the way through, once.

Your favorite goofy random tables are in Roiling Random Text.i7x.

The nudges are in Roiling Nudges.i7x.

To search for your favorite goofy random tables, use ^blurb with a regular-expression search for editors that allow them, such as notepad++ in Windows, which is well worth a download for other reasons. You can also search for (bracket) then xx(first letter) with g = general (for example, blank command/wait responses) or m=manse (for example, comedians Gunter mentions) or v = gritty dialogue, and so forth. XX alone is a (poorly-named) variable in some places, but searching with the bracket and then XX will cover everything.

The new Inform IDE may allow you to search this way, too. For A Roiling Original, I stuck with 6G60. I had enough changes to deal with.

You can place a bracket before any of the other text chunks below to search. They're ordered in approximate priority I used and how often I searched for them.
TOA = the tables of big point scoring changes, table of * anagrams
TOH = table of hint logic
TMC = mega-chatter, which logs all the tables I search lists for
TAF = after-texts, which logs everything said after scanning stuff. Used to help clue the player if something is confusing, whether it's a question mark or vowels/consonants not lining up
TOR/TRB = reflexive blather, asking people about themselves (this is often a default)
TOD = default gen blather, about general nonsense e.g. a misunderstood request
DSB = default subject blather, about a specific topic. If an NPC has no entry, it goes to TOD.
TOB = read ALL the book titles!
TOSB = subj-blather, about a specific subject
TNW = messages for "you can't go that way"
TRE = table of readables
TSX  = differences between sexes
TSH = table of spechelp, so you can see the specialized help for an item
TDR = table of donereject, which gives specialized responses for if you try to flip something that doesn't need it any more
TQT = table of quip texts for GRetta, elMO, ELvira, GUnter. Separated with hyphen
TCO = table of conversations for GRetta, elMO, ELvira, GUnter. Separated with hyphen
DMT = dome tables, text from Demo Dome section

VRT = VOLUME RANDOM TEXT BLURB TABLES has the random text, though it's now in the new file.

TRIX=what I think are nice tricks that may be somewhere near the back of the Inform IDE documentation

Volumes are divided by region for the most part.

[Build this at your own risk. I think you'll get the general idea, but really, it takes 45 seconds to build. Plus you may need special versions of certain modules. They can be found at

http://code.google.com/p/shuffling-around/downloads/list

Glulx Text Effects.i7x
Flexible Windows.i7x

Are the two modified, and there may be a problem with naming Flexible Windows.i7x / Glulx Text Effects.i7x and a 'new' version. So if Inform says there are 2 of one table, you may be reading Glulx Text Effects.i7x and Glulx Text Effects - New.i7x. This is mostly my laziness. But until then I want this caveat in.

macks	"They're so totally wrong, even a sarcastic yes would be just bad."	"Their arguments are too well-constructed for such a simple reject."
Ed Riley	"He doesn't look terribly agreeable."	"Too direct. He'd just reject you to show you he's no YIELDER."

throw-warn is a truth state that varies.

pun-warn is a truth state that varies.

instead of eating a fruit:
	if noun is lemons or noun is melon:

description of player is "As every[if player is female]wo[end if]mannish as ever[if player wears star], and wearing a spiffy star, too[end if]. [one of]You'll never be a [if player is female]Fine Nefi Fein[else]Hunk Kuhn or Icon Nico[end if][one of], or even a or Dreamboat [if player is male]Brad Mateo[else]Amber Dato[end if][or][stopping], and you don't want to be. Because i[or]I[stopping]t's the power inside you that's important[if mrlp is otters and power-back is false]. Well, the power you may need to regain[end if]."

does the player mean examining the player when mrlp is troves: it is very likely.

check examining the player when mrlp is troves:
	say "[one of]You look into your thoughts, feelings and beliefs. You realize they cannot possibly be as pertinent as whatever Peg A. Page has to say. So you defer to her knowledge[or]Your thoughts lead back to the good book[stopping].[line break]";

chapter examining

before deciding the scope of the player (this is the silent scope rule) :
	place the location of the player in scope;
	continue the action;

Include (-
Replace DB_Rule;
-) before "Rulebooks.i6t".

Include (-
[ DB_Rule R N blocked;
	if (R==0 || R==(+ the silent scope rule +)) return;
	print "[Rule ~", (RulePrintingRule) R, "~ ";
	#ifdef NUMBERED_RULES; print "(", N, ") "; #endif;
	if (blocked == false) "applies.]";
	print "does not apply (wrong ", (address) blocked, ").]^";

-) after "Rulebooks.i6t".

does the player mean doing something with location of the player: it is unlikely.

		follow the shutdown rules;
		the rule succeeds;

		say "You are severely outnumbered, captured, and sent to the hold. Maybe they will find out who you are, and maybe not. You will be at either Elvira's mercy or theirs.";
		get-dead;
		follow the shutdown rules;
		the rule succeeds;
	if noun is a target listed in the table of attack-specific:
		choose row with target of noun in table of attack-specific;

	if noun is a guardian:
		say "You need to see into [the noun]'s nature instead[if player has dagger]--that dagger would just make things murder[end if]." instead;
	say "[randbla][line break]" instead;

sign-other is a truth state that varies.

Or, rather, out-think.)[else if fi is washed up]He'd still beat you up, even though he really doesn't want to fight. Wouldn't change that he and [other-guy of fi] are still [i]washups[r].

Hanon Ondricek helped with user-friendliness issues and found the wonderful name Dawn Churlzest, Streever helped with a Heisenbug and lots of release 2/3 stuff, and Marshal Winter found cool stuff. For release 3, Elizabeth McDonald, Joel Webster, Lydia QQ. Dames, Sean M.

the Nitro Intro page is propaganda. it is part of the dope op-ed. the printed name of nitro intro is "Nitro-Intro page". understand "nitro-intro" and "nitro-intro page" as nitro intro page.

description of nitro intro page is "Elvira lays out that she is clearly aliver in her introduction, where she will beat you at your own game.[paragraph break]She notes how Penal Panel--panel IX--explain the Porter Report--the questin['] inquest on your life file. The media aimed you with RELATED! ALERTED! REQUIRES QUERIERS. Governor Ron Grove found taint--a tint. Ties to the Postage Gestapo. Recommended a deport-o-torpedo. Senator Ron East said can't snore at treason.[paragraph break]No hot-plate hate plot on! Elvira is dedicated to making Yorpwald safe, not just from outside forces, but from the influx of silly old anagrams and the LIKELY PERSON BEHIND THEM--a certain reruns nurser! Someone who resorted to boring old anagrams a computer could crank out.[paragraph break]She also notes she will refrain from calling you the obvious name she COULD in an op-ed, because she has class. But really, oppo = poop."

the Questin' Inquest page is propaganda. it is part of the dope op-ed.

description of Questin' Inquest is "[one of]It's headed Good deeds? Sodded ego! Elvira lays out how you saved Yorpwald and all. But everyday stuff? You couldn't repair a flat tyre with flattery, make custard out of car dust or spumoni from an ion sump. Or even a cellphone from cellophane.[paragraph break]You pause. That's so contrived. What kind of faker-freak would think that up?[or]The Questin['] Inquest page is no less annoying the second time around.[cycling]"

understand "questin" and "questin inquest" as inquest.

a thing called the MoneyCo and Economy page is propaganda. it is part of the dope op-ed.

description of MoneyCo is "Elvira notes Yorpwald's more profitable than ever! What's good for MoneyCo is good for Yorpwald! The motto 'Come Yon, Con Em, Yo!' is a coy omen. If there were fraud, it'd have been found out. But one day MoneyCo will deserve to be MyOneCo! I mean, think about it. Elvira is cool. Money is cool. Elvira deserves money! And of course the Trips Strip deserved to become the Strip of Profits! It rousts tourists! Gets us guests!"

The Shatter-Threats page is propaganda. it is part of the dope op-ed. understand "shatter/ threats/ page/" as shatter-threats page when player is in study.

description of Shatter-Threats is "[one of]Elvira notes all political parties have agreed on a do-pry law for Yorpwald. The Swanker Wankers and Ruthless Hustlers and even the fringe Smugger Muggers and Ballsier Liberals. Sporto-troops, rowdies, weirdos gave statements, testaments. It's to fight Evil-Ra, who is everywhere, even if we can't see him, and worse than Ol['] King Jim. We need the Tautest Statute yet. A polished shield-op. Dragnet Granted for Unclear Evils Surveillance. To Finger Fringe so the homeland doesn't become a [d-word] hole, a lamer realm, a stage-one stone age. Everyone's a suspect, including--or especially you. Elvira points out there are only so many nouns LEFT to change, making you a bit useless. But there is a chance you could mess things back up if you were jealous of her popularity.[paragraph break]Besides, it's not like it's the RESTRICT-STRICTER law![paragraph break]There's a bit more.[or]She notes yours was an insecure sinecure. Nice? Sure. But four out of five leading intellectuals, stuffy or non, agree what she has remade should not be reamed. She also notes the law doesn't prevent you from flipping stuff in your own home--just don't get any ideas.[paragraph break]Plus GOOD IDEA has no meaningful anagrams. Worth thinking about![cycling]"

Not really a compelling personal story, you have to admit! Then he gets to Elvira. How before she arrived, Yorpwald was a bit boring, but now it has more reality shows, advertisers and loud opinions than ever.[paragraph break]And how--well, she pointed out it was nice of you to save Yorpwald the first time, but a bunch of pedants looked through dictionaries to ensure there wasn't much left TO change. And how your choosing not to be A Personality was suspicious for sure. And how SHATTER-THREATS would check the anagrammability of stuff so Red Bull Burdell wouldn't happen again. Plus you never helped create cool new slang. But you, of all people, are most likely to form a polit-i-plot. He ends with a yawny anyway, mentioning how liking Elvira is what makes us different from animals, and you should totally write that in your pedanto-notepad.[paragraph break]You already sort of knew this, but Elvira seems to want you out of the way, seriously.

Talked to people who knew where hidden items like the horn-o-honor and gavel of Fogvale were. It was rigged! Now, with her dynamite, tidy name, oh, the soaring signora!

table of pill-comments
pill-thing	pill-do
eeks	"The pills make a racket as they bounce around. A matronly tuna sticks her head out a window and yells IF YOU PLEASE. You notice your friend the trout behind her. He waves to you. The tuna invites you up."
c2	"The pills jump over to the debris and then off somewhere. You think they showed you where the throwing came from."
crate	"The pills jump over to the debris and then swarm in the air like bees, causing your hidden tormentor to shriek and run away."
knob	"The pills gravitate to the knob and turn it forcefully. It won't act up again."
skis	"The pills fly to the skis with a bizarre smooching noise. The skis dissolve, perhaps out of inanimate shame."
clam	"The pills form a large maze with no dead ends. The clam goes after the bouncing pills and eats some, zigzags crazily, and runs himself tired tracking new ones down. Then, suddenly, it looks as if it's seen a ghost. It shrivels to a point with a sad deflating noise, then vanishes with a pop!"
urn	"The urn, being possessed of greed, seems to suck in the pills, which cause it to shake. You run in a random direction as it explodes. Hm, run, urn. You could've figured that, but, well, time to move on."
boats	"A boat pulls over as you spill the pills. 'If ye need a ride, come aboard! We'll collect yer coins...'[paragraph break]Before you can protest, you're aboard. You hear yelling as several of the fish realize the 'coins' are pills. They don't like freeloaders..."
oars	"The pills must've been energy pills, because they jump up and down and attach to the oars and create a reaction that blasts your raft into the air to the other side! With a bump, you tumble out and walk a bit..."
plea	"Some of the crays are dumb enough to think that the pills might be coins. In the ensuing hubbub of arguments between smart fish and dumb fish, you jump over the edge and swim to shore."
carps	"The carps and pikes, distracted by the pills that fall out and keep jumping, ignore the trout. 'You stupid! Those pills are valuable. Out of our way, mouth-breather.' The range anger wells up in you."
tubs	"You spill the pills and slip on them, because no bathmat is around. In the process, you smack your elbow against the tubs. Right on the funny bone. You find it so unfunny you beat the tubs into waste. Which might be hiding more than just that prod you found inside."
prod	"You spill the pills, which bounce around at your legs until you're annoyed enough to start hitting at them with the prod. Foomp! A hidden switch triggers, and the prod transforms to a rigged digger."
heaps	"The pills you spill on the heaps cause a bizarre chemical reaction. You don't feel poisoned, so it can't be too dangerous. You think."
waste	"The pills perform a disturbing chemical reaction with the waste, dissolving to leave a dirty lance."
wrap	"'Man! That might just be the cure for my ears!' The sardine grabs the pills as the first one falls, and in a brief melee, your bubble wrap falls. He flees, and as you run after him, you step on the bubble wrap, causing it to tear and pop.[paragraph break]The wrap feels ruined, now, like you can't warp it, but you do notice a ruby inside. It seems valuable. So you take it."
a-s	"The pills bounce over by the arches. You try to grab them back but wind up grabbing a hidden pearl by mistake."
gleaner	"You absent-mindedly shake the pills out. Some bounce off the general gleaner, which swells oddly, and as you look for cracks or damage, you see a pattern within. A way through a maze."
o-t	"The pills thump all over the floor, but you notice one segment sounds hollow. You go over, look under and--voilà! You are able to defuse the ol['] trap with a switch. Alas, the pills are too scattered to replace. Some kind of spilled into the floor too, but yeah, the five second rule, anyway."
ant	"With the pills dropping around, the ant is distracted, and your wild hacks with the lance easily chase it. But your lance breaks in the process."
ruby	"The pills swarm your ruby so you drop it. They sink into the dirt, the ruby close behind. The dirt fills, leaving a thin hint."
scrawl	"The pills slip into the scrawl, flaring it up. The ground looks extra soft, and you look to see what you can--what's the word? UNEARTH. It's a big weird undead sausage! The sausage cries for its lost ruby!"
haunter	"The haunter stays your hand. Perhaps it had a sad incident in its past which sent it to earth sooner--or made it lose its ruby. It nods at you in understanding."
yapper	"The yapper begins bellyaching about picking up the pills. He complains about how it's HIS job to clean things up. He goes off to look for a wastebasket--but you think you see him popping a pill as he leaves."
d2	 "You spill the pills and hook yourself on the dialer trying to catch them. You wind up REDIALing, and all sorts of hubbub ensues as Elvira's voice crackles, and she accuses the Horned Hedron's leaders of double crossing her, and the Horned Hedron's leaders accuse her. It's great fun to eavesdrop."

Atheists	Salted Deltas	east	"The atheists slowly and painfully explain to you that you're ignoring them and their very logical arguments. You can run away, but running through them--that's just rude."	"The atheists have no shortage of logic, but perhaps their presentation could be adjusted."

table of calparts
thiscal [x calendar] [tdm1]
"Part one: Protean[paragraph break]There's no compelling personal story here. I just had fun trying to make the sort of game I'd have liked when I was younger, the sort Infocom might've done better if the Apple didn't have its limitations.[paragraph break]This part maps how ARO was part of Shuffling Around at first, til I realized that'd be too long for IFComp's two hours. You see how the game started with the stores, how there was F, I, U, V, W and Y, with P being the finale, and how store M didn't exist for a while. In fact, Store R got finished at the very last. It relates how OUTSIDE was the original puzzle until the author realized that was too abstruse, thanks to a tester, and it maps how F and I were first, so they go the good stuff--the nouns--before M started developing. Somewhere along the line, too, I decided to go in for an anagram of Psuedonym. Moe Spudny, Spud Money, Don Muspey and Ed Spumony all seemed amusing, but it wasn't until I remembered a character I wrote for a walkthrough of Deathlord, Ned, that I started poking around. Yompus may not be a real last name, but it sounds like one. So I went with it. Finding it was one of those 'click' moments that didn't solve any technical problems, but it felt cool.[paragraph break]Plus, Andrew Schultz doesn't really anagram well, except to CRAWLS, ZEN, THUD."
"Part two: Wrapt to[paragraph break]I realized that it was probably best to go with nouns-to-nouns. Well, until the last puzzle. This kicked out all but F and I. I didn't know what else to do, or where the finale would be. I eventually decided on R, once I figured a resort would be a good place. It only had the Means Manse, and you just had to EXIST. I think your enemy was Too-Apt Pa Otto, and you had to make him into a POTATO. But that was a bit mean. Then METROS began to take shape, and I liked the underside and hotel, and then other locations fell into place."
"Part three: Trap there? Er, phatter[paragraph break]The big problem I had was that I couldn't disambiguate how to flip items, and I had no encouragement for guesses for anagrams. This was a pretty big fault, and there were others, too. Nevertheless, I found a lot with the help of my testers, and I even had the bright idea of trying to provide an alternate way through Metros. One sub-try got the player stuck. Nevertheless, I was able to identify ways to take care of this throughout the comp, and I had plans for post-release stuff. Every mistake I made served to give me an idea to make things easier for the player. The game needed it. I also settled on the idea for the new hint device. I didn't want to reuse what I had from SA, but I also wanted to make things simpler and more powerful. People had trouble seeing if they could take both devices, so I merged them. And I started on the settler, once people said they wanted something a bit more Master Mind like."
"Part four: tap furor[paragraph break]Nobody was really furious at the game, but I certainly got to work when I learned about David White's hashing. Immediately it made ARO more accessible, in theory. I had a lot to whip into shape. I tried to fix a few things per day. I was disappointed in the bigger mistakes I made, and after getting SA into a decent beta (or so I thought,) I started on ARO."
"Part five: pave rift[paragraph break]The only problem was, once I got back to ARO, it didn't make sense. I had an idea that nouns would only feature in the intro. Oyster was just entering a house and leaving. Routes didn't let you underground. Troves--well, I didn't get the concept of what it should be in the first release, though I had a few passive verbs. I had to look through my master document of anagrams, and I found that a lot I dismissed as too simple wound up fitting just right, and testers particularly liked them. I also figured on interjections for Presto as the last area, because interjections are EXCITING. Towers--well, more on that later. I also wasn't sure what to do with OTHERS, which I had after the Means Manse and before the strip. I eventually decided to chuck it for release 1, as it wasn't as good an introduction as I thought. The diorama was created 2 weeks before 2013 Spring Thing, and I think it was relatively successful. But I left so much to do at the last minute with exiling a region I'd worked on that I missed some big things."
"Part six: star pix[paragraph break]I had hoped to put graphics into the game, and it turned out trickier than I thought. Thankfully Glimmr for Glulx works pretty well, but I would up losing valuable time not using the fonts correctly, due to a dumb mistake. I also failed to stop a buffer overrun in some cases, but that's another story. This was something automation could not catch. I also experimented with some pictures and colored text (Yorpwald/wordplay) but didn't get cover art. I couldn't think of anything simple."
"Part seven: vaster pen[paragraph break]The big problem, though, was what to do with Towers. Originally they were a mess of anagrams like STANCH and CHANTS you had to guess, and you got clues of what was where, and some choices were good and some were evil, and you hacked through the Thickest Thickets. One guy, Elmer, was good, and Merle was evil, and the Coevals['] Alcoves had an elevator where you could go to the various floors and try puzzles. I liked this when OYSTER was small, but Oyster started getting bigger, and Towers became too abstruse with its actions.[paragraph break]It did have hinting, though, and this hinting eventually got repurposed more powerfully and elementally to the settler, but until then, it was a mess. I figured adjectives would be the trickiest things to look at, but a look through my master document gave a lot. At least they weren't as bad as adverbs. I couldn't do anything with them, right? Adverbs were so--powerless."
"Part eight: that gripe, gather pit, tiger path[paragraph break]And that's when it hit me--I could just GREP my anagram file for ly\b, or words that end in LY, and of course you could be powerless near your great foe. The bleary barley came first, then a way to regain your powers--conjunctions were another word that could be very powerful. Then I noticed a slew of animals which hadn't been anagrammed, mostly because I didn't see how to in SA without crowding the game. Things started to click. I even had an enemy to defeat, but she had no character or name. The necro-crone wasn't Elvira til after Spring Thing."
"Part nine: inert nap, pain rent[paragraph break]I was able to get the game working with a walkthrough, and I submitted it okay. Greg Boettcher noted it worked, and he liked the idea, though he diplomatically noted that the walkthrough's cuing helped (translated, this meant I forgot to cue SEVERAL exits.)  I found a few easy bugs post-release and didn't see any reviews for a while. I was at least glad one liked the pedanto-notepad. But I was still frustrated. I was grateful to place second to a very entertaining game (Geoff Moore and I have since helped each other with other works,) and I knew I wanted a post-release fix, but I didn't know the scope. What probably kicked me in the butt was an email from someone named Toby Ott who thanked me for the game. He explained he was blind and liked games like this, but he'd found a few bugs. This moved me from 'I better fix my mistakes' to 'I can make this better for people who like this sort of thing.' I also saw a very good walkthrough with bug reports from David Welbourn. I was happy to note I'd fixed some of the bugs, but he provided cuing beyond the good stuff my testers found, including some help-code that hung the game. I think what they found helped him be able to find stuff without getting TOO frustrated. But again, it was nice people were PLAYING."
"Part ten: pet rant pattern[paragraph break]I thought I'd get the first release out before IFComp 2013, but there were always new bugs to find or puzzles to touch up. I'd fix an area, then move to the next, then be sure the area was paved over smoothly--only to find several 'I saw that, right?' issues. The thing was, there was so much I needed to do, I couldn't get down to the fun aesthetic stuff in good conscience. Eventually I decided on a drop-dead release date early in 2014, but unfortunately I couldn't get to some good transcripts. I left some huge bugs in--ones my testers found--but release 2 made a lot more sense."
"Part eleven: nerve leapt. Vent. Repeal[paragraph break]One of the huge problems I had with testing was the inefficiency of adding one anagram. But with the major issues out of the way, I found ways to do stuff better. How to add names to anagram checking. This caused my bookshelf to add 1000 titles for release 3 and let me name all the authors. I found a way to centralize all the anagram tables so you could see them at the end. I thought I wouldn't use it much, but I wound up adding ten tables more. I used Notepad++ to load quickly and add anagrams when I didn't need to compile, and for my own vanity, I tracked the number of anagrams in the randomized tables and even checked if they conformed to Benford's Law and Zipf's Law. I wrote an anagram-checker. PERL even helped me to detect bad punctuation, capitals or quotes. All this helped me focus on technical stuff. There's so much I thought I'd only use once, but I reused it. All sorts of internal checks (like the tables of anagrams and David White's hashes--in some cases, I wasn't checking right) cleared up. The Table of Nudges grew by several hundreds as I wrote a program to check for the hash value and dump it in a text file for later use. I even managed to write a silly program to check the relative difficulties of the areas. Towers is, by far, the toughest. But I think the most important thing I did was to try and play through one or two areas seriously per week. I needed to let testers['] suggestions soak in. Some puzzles, I thought, weren't perfect, but I didn't have better. But I would up cleaning them up later."
"Part twelve: twerp valet varlet wept[paragraph break]It turns out there's nothing here that was any good, but I liked this sentence."
"Part thirteen: inert? Phatter! Prettier than...[paragraph break]Just having time pass and being able to tighten up puzzles and think of things has been revealing. I write down my notes, look them over, and get on with it. I've never worked as hard at a creative project as I did with this game, but so many times I thought I'd run out of things to do before finding one more. While I figured 'Demo dome mode' shortly before release 2, I never got around to it because there was always something else in the game."
"Final part: plan a rift[paragraph break]I'll have to move on. I had fun with this game as a thought experiment. I enjoyed looking at a phrase, saying I bet that'll anagram, and being right. I also enjoyed finding that a simple anagram could fit nicely in the game's flow. But it all has a diminishing return to scale. I want to move on, but hopefully I'll be able to add new silly books or dialogue on a whim. Github makes it easy to add things--and I wish I'd had it earlier, so I could've tracked other changes. Oh, and if people find bugs (still) I can roll that up, too."

table of informcode
thiscode [x inform wall] [tdm2]
"A chunk of code starting with CheckTranscriptStatus (courtesy of Zarf) notes how the author was able to nag his testers to take a transcript if they left a comment without transcripting on--or to thank them."
"You read various testing commands used in writing the game, including ones to show the exits every move, hint everything visible every move, and track hints without spoiling things for the player. Other commands include jumping to the Strip of Profits, clearing all but Otters, and even jumping to just before the Gates Stage."
"You stare at the start of the Tables of Nudges. There's, like, 1000+! That's over double Shuffling Around! The numbers look confusing and arbitrary, but you recognize the anagram-strings that the game checks for, as well as how room anagrams seem to point to the same error messages. You even see how they were broken into regions, and a region has a table name called table of routes anagrams/nudges, and so forth."
"You stare at the start of the Table of Random Books. Wow, [number of rows in table of random books]! That's a lot of books! The second column seems to give a book a priority, so the player is likely to see certain ones first. Those seem to cover certain puzzles that occur later. It seems like a lot, but there's a note that it was well over two years, and the author just wrote a few neat words from each book to poke at."
"You see some specialized Inform 6 code from Zarf (again,) Climbing Stars (in more than one place--for disabling TRACE for the Oyster puzzle, and for restarting the game after winning) and other people."
"You see a bit more Inform 6 code the author scratched out himself. The main chunk is at https://www.intfic.com/t/i6-stubs-for-i7-programmers/83/6."
"You read more various miscellaneous testing commands, like ones that zap all the guardians, see all the fruits or even show what the player would've missed or alternate paths every move."
"You stare at the various tables of random text. A voice from behind a fourth wall mentions they used to be in lists, and worse, not even alphabetized so that some duplicates could be caught easily."

"Below the code for reducing strings are various comparisons to detect if an anagram has been used, if a book anagram is proper, or if the book matches its author(s)."
"In the book/author notes, there's a few comments about 70% had matching names before the try, and 10% just had bad anagrams, before that was all fixed. And many former author names were shipped off to Shuffling Around to make room for new ones here."
"while ($a = <A>) { if (($a =~ /@ARGV[bracket]0[close bracket]/) && ($a =~ /@ARGV[bracket]1[close bracket]/)) { print '$a matches.'; } } # simple check for if I wrote something already"

"There's code of what appears to be copying critical files to a GitHub directory. Shuffling Around and Roiling files are sent to sister directories, along with the compiled release binaries and lots of utilities."
"The rest is too archaic, but it includes other things I put on [my-repo] include scripts to verify random text anagrams, to create the cheat and non-cheat text in the settler, and even track geometric means of table lengths."

table of observations
obser [from chic loner chronicle] [tdm4]
"I found so many ridiculous anagrams just reading a book on the way to work, or working out, and then I'd just feed them into the anagram server. If ten thousand seems like a lot, well, that is over two years, so that is fifteen per day. That is not so bad when you consider one takes a minute, and I can waste a lot of time in any case."
"One of the best parts of using the anagram server was that I kept seeing cool quotes on the right. These added up to ideas for future games, or even funny jokes, or even more authors to read. It's always a treat when one project gives you spin-off projects."
"A simple I <3 BLOCKSITE FOR FIREFOX. AND GOOGLE CHROME. Well, that's not very philosophical or motivational, but it could be practical."
"It's difficult to describe when an idea has critical weight to branch out. For things like the responses to waiting or blank commands, I maybe had a few in one of/or loops, until I sat down and concentrated on words that meant doing nothing. It took a while to find, but once I had, say, six, I sat down and tried to stretch it to ten, when I put it in a table for the player to see at the end."
"Many of my ideas come from everyday things. I didn't pay religious attention to my file of anagrams once I put down the initial puzzles. However, having two testers say, this seemed a bit wobbly, got me thinking. There were puzzles I liked, and I recruited the best talent available, so to speak. But like on a sports team, the most impressive athlete doesn't necessarily fit. It was hard to retire favorite anagrams or demote them, but it was necessary. And I got some good mileage with ones I'd passed up because I thought I had enough good ones. The diners in release 3 are probably the best example of this."
"It wasn't until I established an assembly line for writing things up that I really started getting the anagrams in place. Before, I sent things to my daily writing, which sorted ideas to a big file by region. Once I cemented ARO as a big project to dedicate time to directly, I didn't have that hurdle, and things went faster."
"I'm still amazed how much organization helped me. Before, I might see an anagram and wonder where it went. Once I organized the anagram types into the Table of Megachatter, it became a lot clearer what would go where, and I could add a new category if I wanted. The one of/or constructions--where things cycled every three times you observed--billowed out to tables. As did lists, where it was tough just to insert one idea. I figured how to make a final note, too, before cycling."
"I even found it easy to add new or break-off tables. For instance, the schematic catechism (one of the last anagrams I wanted to do something with but I didn't know what) originally just had random ideas. Then it had research topics. Then it had Brainy People. Again, none of this would've happened if I hadn't also written code that let me shift between tables."
"Once the anagrams started flowing, and I started adding alternate solutions, ARO started taking a long time to compile. Like 30 seconds. So I tried to place in random text and so forth while I built, since that was low-risk for recompiling. I had one rather bad bug which the Inform 6.32 compiler didn't track (http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXcompilersXinform6Xexecutables.html got the new version) but mostly it was just a matter of writing stuff down and feeding it to a computer. It was much more fun procrastination than others. I found stuff to do (book reading) while something compiled, and that made having to raise an in-program constant less unbearable."
"Many of the puzzles just didn't make sense in the first version. But I was able to sort them out by ones that needed to be changed and ones that would be nice to. I found a lot of times I had to let a tester's observation sit for about two weeks before changing something: gee, it'd be nice to..."
"Perhaps the last thing I enjoyed looking up was that my data roughly obeyed both Zipf's and Benford's Law. I put the megachatter table rows and byte totals as data points into a graph at http://benford.jplusplus.org/, and while each looked pretty good by itself, together they gave a very low z-statistic. Zipf's law was a little trickier--the upper and lower halves of the data had different trend lines. I impart this to how I just sort of added a bunch of tables late, so of course thouse would sink to the bottom. While a few later tables gained traction (posse bosses, lame talk shows and comedians,) many were just neat to get to ten, and I didn't add to them."
"I also found that, by the end, I spent more time adding anagrams than actual bug fixes to Shuffling and Roiling. But it was fun, and I felt I was doing something every day. Still, it got to be time consuming, and it took a while before I figured a way to add stuff to a separate text file, push a button, and add it to source."
"Learned Helplessness is a powerful thing, and you can always be sucked back down into it: there's that silly voice in my head saying 'Haven't you gotten enough shortcuts?' Larry Wall's delightful oversimplification of the three programming virtues has helped me a lot, here, but I think the real way to frame things is: with the tools I have now, X would be too tough. I don't see how to fix it, yet, but I will."
"One thing I wish I'd done earlier, that would've given me more shortcuts, was setting up my GitHub account. The simple graph of what you've done today (green vs. grey) is great motivation to do something/anything, and if it isn't much, that's motivation to do more next time."
"Finally, I'm just grateful I had so much fun exploring so many alleys and polishing so many odd things. I hope you had even half as much fun playing as I did writing the Stale Tales Slate."

Store H	"[one of]If you haven't solved the game proper, you won't be able to get into Store H.[plus][or]Store H appears radically different from the rest of the store.

Store K	"[one of]Store K is not critical, because it's a bit of American slang.[plus][or]What is the suspicious smelling smoke?[plus][or]The smoke is marijuana, but STONER doesn't quite work on Store N.[plus][or]The residents of Store K want to REST, OK? That hint knocks out the vowels with the settler.[plus][or]Also, they yell don't have a STROKE![plus][or]You can also assume they are plural, so S is last.[plus][or]They are TOKERS.[minus][cycling]"
Store N	"[one of]Looks like there's a guy in Store N.

Store P	"[one of]You seem to need a magic word, and the tropes poster plus Store P give you a few hints.[plus][or]In particular, you see two blinking colors, which means the first two letters are P/T O/R.[plus][or]But the second must be a consonant.

Store T	"[one of]Cute squeaky noises from burrows there by a river. There must be many such animals. As if there's some animal that this industrial buildup has displaced.[plus][or]There are four choices left, if you use the settler, but what is a riverside animal?[plus][or]OTTERS.[minus][cycling]"
Store U	"[one of]The roads in Store U. What's another word for that? They're numbered, too.[plus][or]The settler's a big help here, as it knocks out the vowel. Then you can try where T should go. Or better yet, you can guess that whatever it is is plural, and that knocks things out logically.[plus][or]Not just any old roads but ones with signs for bus stops, etc.[plus][or]ROUTES.[minus][cycling]"

Store V	"[one of]You see sparkling inside if you look at the right angle. Well, several angles.[plus][or]Hmm, treasures. Where do you find treasures? (Word-logic clues follow before the solution.)[plus][or]If you use the settler, you can figure which vowels are where.[plus][or]Then you can figure the first letter, since you have CCVCVC, and many two-consonant combinations don't work well to start.[plus][or]You should wind up with TROVES.[minus][cycling]"
voters	"You can scan the voters if you can't figure what Store V should be."
Store W	"[one of]You may wish to look at the description, though RESTOW also allows a clue.[plus][or]Store W seems taller than the other stores, like it has several levels. It's just an illusion.

shells	"The shells clue that Store Y might become something that lives in a shell."
Store Y	"[one of]Hm, looks slimy on the inside, and it smells like saltwater too. It's also a weird shell shape, Store Y is. What sea life do you know that has a Y in it?[plus][or]Also, if you use the Letters Settler, you'll notice a letter that's a new color--orange. A combination of yellow and red.[plus][or]What letter can be a vowel or a consonant?[plus][or]Y.
