"A Roiling Original" by Andrew Schultz

volume browsing and building notes

[This initial section is to try and organize the source code. Of course, with a 2.4 million+ byte file, it's sort of tough to figure where to start. I can't promise that my code is super-readable, but I hope you find it interesting. It's been vetted all the way through, once.

To search for your favorite goofy random tables, use ^blurb with a regular-expression search for editors that allow them, such as notepad++ in Windows, which is well worth a download for other reasons. You can also search for (bracket) then xx(first letter) with g = general (for example, blank command/wait responses) or m=manor (for example, comedians Gunter mentions) or v = gritty dialogue, and so forth. XX alone is a (poorly-named) variable in some places, but searching with the bracket and then XX will cover everything.

The new Inform IDE may allow you to search this way, too. For A Roiling Original, I stuck with 6G60. I had enough changes to deal with.

You can place a bracket before any of the other text chunks below to search. They're ordered in approximate priority I used and how often I searched for them.
TOA = the table of big point scoring changes, table of anagrams
TOH = table of hint logic
TON = nudge for good guesses
TSH = specific help for specific items you have the right anagram for
TMC = mega-chatter, which logs all the tables I search lists for
TAF = after-texts, which logs everything said after scanning stuff. Used to help clue the player if something is confusing, whether it's a question mark or vowels/consonants not lining up
TOR = reflexive blather, asking people about themselves (this is often a default)table of reflexive-blather      [ask x about x] [tor]
TOD = default gen blather, about general nonsense e.g. a misunderstood request
DSB = default subject blather, about a specific topic. If an NPC has no entry, it goes to TOD.
TOB = read ALL the book titles!
TOSB = subj-blather, about a specific subject
TNW = messages for "you can't go that way"
TSX  = differences between sexes
TSH = table of spechelp, so you can see the specialized help for an item
TSR = table of specreject, which gives specialized responses for if you try to flip something that doesn't need it any more
DMT = dome tables, text from Demo Dome section

VRT = VOLUME RANDOM TEXT BLURB TABLES has the random text.

Volumes are divided by region for the most part.

[you may need special versions of certain modules. They can be found at

http://code.google.com/p/shuffling-around/downloads/list

Glulx Text Effects.i7x
Flexible Windows.i7x

Are the two modified, and there may be a problem with naming Flexible Windows.i7x / Glulx Text Effects.i7x and a 'new' version. So if Inform says there are 2 of one table, you may be reading Glulx Text Effects.i7x and Glulx Text Effects - New.i7x. This is mostly my laziness. But until then I want this caveat in.

Then he gets to Elvira. How before she arrived, Yorpwald was a bit boring, but now it has more reality shows, advertisers and loud opinions than ever.[paragraph break]And how--well, she pointed out it was nice of you to save Yorpwald the first time, but a bunch of pedants looked through dictionaries to ensure there wasn't much left TO change. And how your choosing not to be A Personality was suspicious for sure. And how SHATTER-THREATS would check the anagrammability of stuff so Red Bull Burdell wouldn't happen again.

toy-theory-quip	"You've sort of heard it, and you've sort of thought it, but yeah.

trial-trail-quip	"'More trouble, more stores. Six of [']em. But you can't just switch stuff to other stuff. That'd be more hokey and homeworky. You'll have to infer finer things to upset the setup.'

t-quip	"'Store T, well, I've never seen anyone even try to buy stuff. People walk away. Like there's an Or-Not-O-Tron near it. I'd wait on it. But it might have hints about the other stores.'"
u-quip	"'Store U used to hold all sorts of road maps, telling people where to go without directions. I hear it's hooked up to some place where people can't think or walk straight.

Ali and his go-mad dogma about St. Rich, the god of lie, the good life has left people without directions.'"
v-quip	"'Store V used to hold a bunch of self-help books that taught you how to think wrong. But the proprietor moved on to lectures. More lucrative. Self-help industries have overrun Yorpwald. Spoiloplis is the big hub. Mayor's Irv Lea. But you may not even need to meet him.'"
w-quip	"'Store W, well, everyone seems to have a different word to describe what's going on there in the Bland Sad Badlands. People protecting their territory just because. Castle Apcur, the Curst Palace, lies there, at the other side of Leak Lake. They say it's being torn down to make a new MoneyCo office. Tax-free and all. Oh, and luxury condos endorsed by Avrile, that lifestyle maven. But if you could restore the palace somehow...'"

lamp-quip	"'Yeah, sorry about the lamp.' You say no worries--you're trying to figure what it means. Elmo doesn't judge. 'Yeah, you been under stress, I bet, let's work it out.'

a rich chair is useless scenery in Dusty Study. "You thought you preferred a recliner but this is real. Nicer. It guards against cushionless slouchiness.

the bookshelf is amusing scenery in dusty study. "[one of]It's engraved READING A DINGER, I GANDER and sturdy enough to withstand any magic transformations. It's far too heavy to move to make a secret passage, what with [book-est] sloven novels (writing and appearance) you just got SENT, somehow, from trailery to literary discouraging infectious fiction use--the titles blur so fast through your mind, the oeuvres overuse--well, YOU know.

the giant pin is a semi-easy LLPish thing in Dusty Study. "A giant pin (bowling) hangs on the wall here.". description is "Man, it's a giant pin. Cardboard, too. It's never managed to bowl or blow over any guests despite being surprisingly artsy."

instead of pushing or pulling giant pin:
	say "It won't budge. It's too thin to hide a way out, too.";

understand "nip" as a mistake ("Maybe if it weren't a giant pin. Well, giant enough to hide a wall safe.")

a-text of giant pin is "RYYRRYRR". b-text of giant pin is "RYYPPYRR".

instead of taking giant pin:
	say "That'd be dreadfully impractical. It's too [i]giant[r] a t'ing.";

the abstract painting is a useless LLPish undesc. "That painting you changed from a giant pin hangs here."

instead of doing something with abstract painting when abstract painting is visible:
	if current action is taking or searching or attacking:
		say "It's a false law there has to be a wall safe behind it. Besides, [if Gunter is off-stage]the person knocking might see what you're doing[else]you got enough goodies so far[end if]. You remember it was sort of based on parts of your manor." instead;
	unless action is procedural:
		say "The painting's really just there to be observed. Like most art." instead;
	say "The painting gives no pure-art rapture, though you muse 'Quite an antique. I put it up.' and notice a place where horses are kept, a roof with smoke rising, and a downstairs living place. It's not exactly worth looking at in detail, but it's just good to know it's there.";

propaganda is a kind of thing. propaganda is usually amusing.

the dope op-ed is propaganda. "That 'dope' op-ed Gunter threw at you landed here. It's a lot longer than your usual op-ed, probably terribly overwritten, but possible to enjoy if you like that sort of thing.". description is "The dope op-ed is broken into several pages. It's by Elvira, and it's apparently tackling you on your own ground. The pages are labeled nitro-intro, questin['] inquest, MoneyCo and Economy, Shatter-Threats, [if player is male]I Trash His Art[else]Her Arts Er Trash[end if], and By Li'l Billy."

description of Shatter-Threats is "[one of]Elvira notes all political parties have agreed on a do-pry law for Yorpwald. The Swanker Wankers and Ruthless Hustlers and even the fringe Smugger Muggers and Ballsier Liberals. Sporto-troops, rowdies, weirdos gave statements, testaments. It's to fight Evil-Ra, who is everywhere, even if we can't see him, and worse than Ol['] King Jim. We need the Tautest Statute yet. A polished shield-op. Dragnet Granted for Unclear Evils Surveillance. To Finger Fringe so the homeland doesn't become a [d-word] hole, a lamer realm, a stage-one stone age. Everyone's a suspect, including--or especially you. Elvira points out there are only so many nouns LEFT to change, making you a bit useless.

Nice? Sure. But four out of five leading intellectuals, stuffy or non, agree what she has remade should not be reamed.

book Cruelest Lectures

Cruelest Lectures is an innie room in Stores. "You're standing in the back of an uncomfortable auditorium[one of]. People stare at a lecturer as if they've been drugged. Um, hypnotized[or][stopping]. Nearby, a passage leads to[if e-revealed is false] somewhere called[end if] Studio E."

check looking in lectures for the first time:
	say "As you march through the smoke, you hear 'Freeze! Anti-drug drag unit!' You turn around to see a tall bulky man wearing a T-shirt saying 'IAN. A DRUG GUARDIAN. QUADS SQUAD.'[paragraph break]'So! you're one of those people who have been poking around stores K and N. But these are no-drugs grounds. We finger fringe like you. [if smoke cloud is examined]Second hand funny-smoke. No rationalizations about how you cheat drug lords that way. It's an entry drug and that's facts. [end if]Let's go.'[paragraph break]He frog-marches you to an auditorium. It's quite a crowd, and you're a bit late, so you can't even sit.";

the seats are useless plural-named scenery in lectures. "'If you'd gotten here earlier, you might've gotten one,' growls Ian. You're not sure that'd make sense even if you actually [i]were[r] stoned."

instead of doing something to the seats:
	if current action is scaning:
		say "You consider scanning them, but it'd freak out the audience. Or Ian. Or the lecturer." instead;
	if action is procedural:
		continue the action;
	try examining seats instead;

rule for supplying a missing noun when entering:
	if location of player is Hero's shore:
		try entering raft;
	if location of player is Strip of Profits and number of visible portals is 1:

	if location of player is Cruelest Lectures:
		if the player's command matches the text "sit":

the passage is scenery in lectures. "The passage that leads to Studio E seems unguarded. Maybe you could sneak in there."

instead of scaning passage:
	if e-revealed is true:
		say "You already got YYRRGRG from it.";
	else:
		say "Be brave! ENTER the passage!";

understand "studio e/" as passage.

e-revealed is a truth state that varies.

[strudel/lsd-ture and joke if eat after visiting]

the lecturer is a reflexive person in Cruelest Lectures. "A lecturer lectures lecturingly about why his wasting your time is better for society than how you waste your time. And how the sooner you agree, the less you'll waste HIS time, and the golden rule and stuff."

check scaning lecturer:
	say "You point your settler at the tedious lecturer.";

a-text of lecturer is "YYRRYRY". b-text of lecturer is "YYRRYRY".

understand "max p lee" and "max/lee" and "max lee" as lecturer.

description of lecturer is "He's wearing a very expensive suit and tie. You're not sure why they should be expensive, but you know they are. They're probably about as showy as drug dealers['] $5,000 suits and $300 ties. You read MAX P LEE, EXAMPLE projected behind him, and he is sponsored by RutCorp, who help pull you out of ruts, apparently."

idg is a privately-named person in Cruelest Lectures. printed name of idg is "Ian (a Drug Guardian)". description is "'What? Those biceps are from pure hard work. And a proper diet. And the right vitamins.' He nods and points to the lecturer.". "Standing by the only exit is Ian (a Drug Guardian.)"

understand "ian" and "drug/guardian" and "guardian" as idg.

instead of doing something with idg:
	if current action is scaning:
		say "'No offense, chum, but it's me who should probably be scanning you lawbreakers.' He nods and smiles, faux-friendly, and you turn back to the lecturer." instead;
	if current action is attacking:
		say "He's too big for you." instead;
	if player does not have heartfelt reflections:
		say "Before you can do anything with or to Ian, he thrusts a sheet of heartfelt reflections on drug use at you[one of][or] again[or] yet again[stopping]. 'It will help you in ways you don't know. And even I don't know.' Do you take it?";
		if the player consents:
			now player has heartfelt reflections;
			say "'Good choice. Say, if they're good enough, do you think you could put in a word for me--to a lecturer like THAT?" instead;

			say "Ian looks hurt, then blames it on the lack of attention span from the drugs you've been taking. That cheers him up." instead;
	otherwise:
		if action is procedural:
			continue the action;
		say "Before you can do anything, Ian points at the heartfelt reflections he shared on you. Or at you. But not just plain with you. He's so much bigger than you, it distracts you from whatever you meant to do.";

The heartfelt reflections are plural-named thing.

after doing something with reflections:
	set pronoun it to reflections;

description of reflections is "It's a list of thirty-odd sentences beginning I USED TO. It's in hard-hitting simple language but no less painful to read for all that. I will spare you the details--a brochure's such a borer."

Elvira's excitement had matured, and he didn't realize how good she was at pointing out people's faults. It would help to improve them."

	say "[one of]You hear a conversation. Men trying to impress--yes, it's Gretta Garett-Tatger--here. Their pick-up lines and stories are just horrible. But that's how it is, with macks. Or whatever annoying flirters are called these days[or]The macks continue to annoy Gretta[how-macked][stopping].";
	now Gretta is mentioned;
	now macks are mentioned;

to say how-macked:
	if macked-out is 1:
		say ", though not as much as when they started, since you got them";
	else if macked-out is 2:
		say ", but they're wavering a bit. If you blow up their flow once more, you could probably get rid of them"

Gretta Garett-Tatger is a female person in fro. "[bug-report]". description of Gretta is "She seems to be cringing at the pick-up lies, or the prospect she will let one work so she doesn't have to listen to them anymore."

before doing something when Gretta is visible and macks are not visible:
	if current action is examining:
		say "You should probably talk with Gretta Garett-Tatger a bit." instead;
	if current action is attacking:
		say "She's on your side." instead;
	if action is blathery:
		say "She's heard enough rambling conversation on others['] terms, here." instead;
	if current action is not talking to Gretta and current action is not QBC responding with:
		say "[convoforce].";
		reject the player's command;
	continue the action.

the litany of Gretta Garett-Tatger is the table of Gretta comments.

chapter smacking

smacking is an action applying to one thing.

understand the command "smack" as something new.

understand "smack [thing]" as smacking.

does the player mean smacking the macks: it is likely.

carry out smacking:
	if noun is macks:
		say "They really, really deserve it, but keep your cool. Smack their arguments down instead and they may smack each other for you." instead;
	try attacking noun instead;
	the rule succeeds;

chapter medals

the medals are a reflexive wearable plural-named thing.

understand "iq medal" and "iq" and "lucky medal" and "lucky" as medals.

after printing the name of medals while taking inventory:
	say " ([if nounsolve < 3 and adjsolve < 3]very tarnished[else if nounsolve >= 3 and adjsolve >= 3]polished[else]somewhat tarnished[end if])";

understand "medals" as a mistake("For shame! The macks only want to make her a FIGURATIVE trophy. Do something to earn some medals, like helping Gretta Garett-Tatger.") when Gretta Garett-Tatger is visible

description of the medals is "They're roped together--the smaller, [tarn of nounsolve]oxidized, says IQ, and the other, [tarn of adjsolve]tarnished, says LUCKY."

to say tarn of (tlev - a number):
	if tlev is 0:
		say "totally ";
	say "[if tlev is 0]extremely [else if tlev is 1]very [else if tlev is 2]somewhat[else if tlev is 3]barely [else if tlev is 4]un[else]BUG[end if]";

medals-lucky-first is a truth state that varies.

check switching on the medals:
	med-flip instead;

check switching off the medals:
	med-flip instead;

to med-flip:
	unless the player's command matches the regular expression "\b(on|off)\b":
		say "(Okay, silly parser stuff--just switch the medals)";
	say "You switch the medals so the [if medals-lucky-first is true]larger[else]smaller[end if] is on the right.";
	if medals-lucky-first is false:
		now medals-lucky-first is true;
	else:
		now medals-lucky-first is false;
	the rule succeeds;

nounsolve is a number that varies.
adjsolve is a number that varies.

check scaning medals:
	if nounsolve < 3 or adjsolve < 3:
		say "The settler reads oddly for a while but doesn't show anything. Maybe you need to reveal the medals some more." instead;

a-text of medals is "RYYRRRO". b-text of medals is "[if medals-lucky-first is true]RGYRRRO[else]RYYRRRB[end if][one of]--hmm, maybe if you switched the medals, you might get another clue. If you need it.[or][stopping]".

chapter ladying

ladying is an action applying to nothing.

irately is a truth state that varies.

understand the command "blearily/cattily/coitally/despairingly/drawlingly/formally/irately/martially/nastily/ribaldly/seedily/shadily/silently/snidely/sobbingly/starkly/tearil/tediously/wearingly" as something new.

understand "bleary" and "catty" and "coital" and "despairing" and "drawling" and "formal" and "irate" and "martial" and "nasty" and "ribald" and "seedy" and "shady" and "silent" and "snide" and "sobbing" and "stark" and "steamy" and "teary" and "tedious" and "wearing" as a mistake ("That might've worked back in the Towers area, if these idiots were hitting on a woman in the Loftier Trefoil. But you're not powerful enough for that. You'll need to type two whole more letters."). [??]

carry out ladying:
	let mackstate be false;

	repeat through table of mack behaviors:

			now still-doable entry is false;
			process-macks instead;
	say "[reject]" instead;

macked-out is a number that varies. macked-out is usually 0.

check talking to Gretta when macks are in fro:
	say "The macks are monopolizing the conversation. They outnumber you." instead;

to process-macks:
	increment macked-out;
	if macked-out is 1:

She shuffles her feet a bit, unsure whether to leave or stay. She must have had a reason to hang around the bulwark in the first place. But you can't ask that straight out.";
		now macks are in lalaland;
		reg-inc;
		try talking to Gretta;
		continue the action;
	reg-inc;

check going in fro when Gretta is visible:
	if noun is north or noun is south or noun is east:

to say cree-pee:
	say "A few macks [if player is male]laugh at how you obviously can't give Gretta Garett-Tatger the attention they can[else]let Gretta Garett-Tatger know she's more worth impressing than you[end if] as you leave"

check taking atmo-moat:
	say "Way too big." instead;

check going west in fro:
	if macks are in fro:
		say "One of the macks stops you from tripping the atmo-moat, and he tries to convince Gretta he's a great guy for saving you. The others yell at him for trying to play hero too obviously." instead;
	if atmo-moat is in fro:
		say "The moat just--scares you. It's too red, and when you recognize it as an atmo-moat, it turns blue, but it's still scary." instead;
	if Gretta is visible:
		say "[cree-pee]." instead;

pill-thing	pill-do
eeks	"The pills make a racket as they bounce around. A matronly tuna sticks her head out a window and yells IF YOU PLEASE. You notice your friend the trout behind her. He waves to you. The tuna invites you up."
c2	"The pills jump over to the debris and then off somewhere. You think they showed you where the throwing came from."
crate	"The pills jump over to the debris and then swarm in the air like bees, causing your hidden tormentor to shriek and run away."
knob	"The pills gravitate to the knob and turn it forcefully. It won't act up again."
skis	"The pills fly to the skis with a bizarre smooching noise. The skis dissolve, perhaps out of inanimate shame."
clam	"The pills form a large maze with no dead ends. The clam goes after the bouncing pills and eats some, zigzags crazily, and runs himself tired tracking new ones down. Then, suddenly, it looks as if it's seen a ghost. It shrivels to a point with a sad deflating noise, then vanishes with a pop!"
urn	"The urn, being possessed of greed, seems to suck in the pills, which cause it to shake. You run in a random direction as it explodes. Hm, run, urn. You could've figured that, but, well, time to move on."
boats	"A boat pulls over as you spill the pills. 'If ye need a ride, come aboard! We'll collect yer coins...'[paragraph break]Before you can protest, you're aboard. You hear yelling as several of the fish realize the 'coins' are pills. They don't like freeloaders..."
oars	"The pills must've been energy pills, because they jump up and down and attach to the oars and create a reaction that blasts your raft into the air to the other side! With a bump, you tumble out and walk a bit..."
plea	"The crays are dumb enough to think that the pills might be coins. In the ensuing hubbub, you jump over the edge and swim to shore."
carps	"The carps and pikes, distracted by the pills that fall out and keep jumping, ignore the trout. 'You stupid! Those pills are valuable. Out of our way, mouth-breather.' The range anger wells up in you."
lance	"The pills somehow dissolve the ugly bits on the lance. It's the retractable sort, which is handy for carrying."
tubs	"You spill the pills and slip on them, because no bathmat is around. In the process, you smack your elbow against the tubs. Right on the funny bone. You find it so unfunny you beat the tubs into waste. Which might be hiding more than just that prod you found inside."
prod	"You spill the pills, which bounce around at your legs until you're annoyed enough to start hitting at them with the prod. Foomp! A hidden switch triggers, and the prod transforms to a rigged digger."
heaps	"The pills you spill on the heaps cause a bizarre chemical reaction. You don't feel poisoned, so it can't be too dangerous. You think."
waste	"The pills perform a disturbing chemical reaction with the waste, dissolving to leave a dirty lance."
wrap	"'Man! That might just be the cure for my ears!' The sardine grabs the pills as the first one falls, and in a brief melee, your bubble wrap falls. He flees, and as you run after him, you step on the bubble wrap, causing it to tear and pop.[paragraph break]The wrap feels ruined, now, like you can't warp it, but you do notice a ruby inside. It seems valuable. So you take it."
a-s	"The pills bounce over by the arches. You try to grab them back but wind up grabbing a hidden pearl by mistake."
gleaner	"You absent-mindedly shake the pills out. Some bounce off the general gleaner, and as you look for cracks or damage, you see a pattern within. A way through a maze."
o-t	"The pills thump all over the floor, but you notice one segment sounds hollow. You go over, look under and--voilà! You are able to defuse the ol['] trap with a switch. Alas, the pills are too scattered to replace. Some kind of spilled into the floor too, but yeah, the five second rule, anyway."
ant	"With the pills dropping around, the ant is distracted, and your wild hacks with the lance easily chase it. But your lance breaks in the process."
ruby	"The pills swarm your ruby so you drop it. They sink into the dirt, the ruby close behind. The dirt fills, leaving a thin hint."

understand "PG-on-up gun" and "gun" as popgun.

understand "nobig" and "no big" as a mistake ("[if boing is reflexed]Hey, now, that's just humblebragging[else]Overconfidence is sort of the way, here. But it needs to be backed up with an idea[end if].") when popgun is visible.

rule for printing room description details of the PG-on-up popgun:

description of serial number is "B09140715."

check inserting it into (this is the dart-popgun rule):
	if second noun is popgun and boing is reflexive:
		if noun is dart:
			say "It seems like it should fit, but it doesn't. You can't quite compress the boing mechanism right, but if you had a moment of insight, you could." instead;

book Phat Path

Phat Path is a room in Presto.

description of lawl wall is "A spams-spasm of bad jokes, and I'd tell you a few, but it'd be a bigger time sink than playing games where you point and click instead of just sensibly typing. It seems to be laughing at your lack of progress. You can see keys on the wall."

the keys are part of the lawl wall. the keys are reflexive. description is "You're pretty sure the keys open the lawl wall, since the hogs are keeping an eye on them, but you can't be sure."

the hogs are reflexive plural-named people in Phat Path. description is "They're as big as Leo and Rand but meaner. Plus there are three of them. They look a little smarter, too--but maybe you can use reverse psychology to get under their skin or sneak those keys on the wall.".

"Part one: Protean[paragraph break]This part maps how ARO was part of Shuffling Around at first, til I realized that'd be too long for IFComp's two hours. You see how the game started with the stores, how there was F, I, U, V, W and Y, with P being the finale, and how store M didn't exist for a while. In fact, Store R got finished at the very last. It relates how OUTSIDE was the original puzzle until the author realized that was too abstruse, thanks to a tester, and it maps how F and I were first, so they go the good stuff--the nouns--before M started developing. Somewhere along the line, too, I decided to go in for an anagram of Psuedonym. Moe Spudny, Spud Money, Don Muspey and Ed Spumony all seemed amusing, but it wasn't until I remembered a character I wrote for a walkthrough of Deathlord, Ned, that I started poking around. Yompus may not be a real last name, but it sounds like one. So I went with it. Finding it was one of those 'click' moments that didn't solve any technical problems, but it felt cool.[paragraph break]Plus, Andrew Schultz doesn't really anagram well."
"Part two: Wrapt to[paragraph break]I realized that it was probably best to go with nouns-to-nouns. Well, until the last puzzle. This kicked out all but F and I. I didn't know what else to do, or where the finale would be. I eventually decided on R, once I figured a resort would be a good place. It only had the Manor, and you just had to EXIST. I think your enemy was Too-Apt Pa Otto, and you had to make him into a POTATO. But that was a bit mean. Then METROS began to take shape, and I liked the underside and hotel, and then other locations fell into place."
"Part three: Trap there? Er, phatter[paragraph break]The big problem I had was that I couldn't disambiguate how to flip items, and I had no encouragement for guesses for anagrams. This was a pretty big fault, and there were others, too. Nevertheless, I found a lot with the help of my testers, and I even had the bright idea of trying to provide an alternate way through Metros. One sub-try got the player stuck. Nevertheless, I was able to identify ways to take care of this throughout the comp, and I had plans for post-release stuff. Every mistake I made served to give me an idea to make things easier for the player. The game needed it. I also settled on the idea for the new hint device. I didn't want to reuse what I had from SA, but I also wanted to make things simpler and more powerful. People had trouble seeing if they could take both devices, so I merged them. And I started on the settler, once people said they wanted something a bit more Master Mind like."
"Part four: tap furor[paragraph break]Nobody was really furious at the game, but I certainly got to work when I learned about David White's hashing. Immediately it made ARO more accessible, in theory. I had a lot to whip into shape. I tried to fix a few things per day. I was disappointed in the bigger mistakes I made, and after getting SA into a decent beta (or so I thought,) I started on ARO."
"Part five: pave rift[paragraph break]The only problem was, once I got back to ARO, it didn't make sense. I had an idea that nouns would only feature in the intro. Oyster was just entering a house and leaving. Routes didn't let you underground. Troves--well, I didn't get the concept of what it should be in the first release, though I had a few passive verbs. I had to look through my master document of anagrams, and I found that a lot I dismissed as too simple wound up fitting just right, and testers particularly liked them. I also figured on interjections for Presto as the last area, because interjections are EXCITING. Towers--well, more on that later. I also wasn't sure what to do with OTHERS, which I had after the manor and before the strip. I eventually decided to chuck it for release 1, as it wasn't as good an introduction as I thought. The diorama was created 2 weeks before 2013 Spring Thing, and I think it was relatively successful. But I left so much to do at the last minute with exiling a region I'd worked on that I missed some big things."
"Part six: star pix[paragraph break]I had hoped to put graphics into the game, and it turned out trickier than I thought. Thankfully Glimmr for Glulx works pretty well, but I would up losing valuable time not using the fonts correctly, due to a dumb mistake. I also failed to stop a buffer overrun in some cases, but that's another story. This was something automation could not catch. I also experimented with some pictures and colored text (Yorpwald/wordplay) but didn't get cover art. I couldn't think of anything simple."
"Part seven: vaster pen[paragraph break]The big problem, though, was what to do with Towers. Originally they were a mess of acronyms like STANCH and CHANTS you had to guess, and you got clues of what was where, and some choices were good and some were evil, and you hacked through the Thickest Thickets. One guy, Elmer, was good, and Merle was evil, and the Coevals['] Alcoves had an elevator where you could go to the various floors and try puzzles. I liked this when OYSTER was small, but Oyster started getting bigger, and Towers became too abstruse with its actions.[paragraph break]It did have hinting, though, and this hinting eventually got repurposed more powerfully and elementally to the settler, but until then, it was a mess. I figured adjectives would be the trickiest things to look at, but a look through my master document gave a lot. At least they weren't as bad as adverbs. I couldn't do anything with them, right? Adverbs were so--powerless."
"Part eight: that gripe, gather pit, tiger path[paragraph break]And that's when it hit me--I could just GREP my anagram file for ly\b, or words that end in LY, and of course you could be powerless near your great foe. The bleary barley came first, then a way to regain your powers--conjunctions were another word that could be very powerful. Then I noticed a slew of animals which hadn't been anagrammed, mostly because I didn't see how to in SA without crowding the game. Things started to click. I even had an enemy to defeat, but she had no character or name. The necro-crone wasn't Elvira til after Spring Thing."
"Part nine: inert nap, pain rent[paragraph break]I was able to get the game working with a walkthrough, and I submitted it okay. Greg Boettcher noted it worked, and he liked the idea, though he diplomatically noted that the walkthrough's cuing helped (translated, this meant I forgot to cue SEVERAL exits.)  I found a few easy bugs post-release and didn't see any reviews for a while. I was at least glad one liked the pedanto-notepad. But I was still frustrated. I was grateful to place second to a very entertaining game (Geoff Moore and I have since helped each other with other works,) and I knew I wanted a post-release fix, but I didn't know the scope. What probably kicked me in the butt was an email from someone named Toby Ott who thanked me for the game. He explained he was blind and liked games like this, but he'd found a few bugs. This moved me from 'I better fix my mistakes' to 'I can make this better for people who like this sort of thing.' I also saw a very good walkthrough with bug reports from David Welbourn. I was happy to note I'd fixed some of the bugs, but he provided cuing beyond the good stuff my testers found, including some help-code that hung the game. I think what they found helped him be able to find stuff without getting TOO frustrated. But again, it was nice people were PLAYING."
"Part ten: pet rant pattern[paragraph break]I thought I'd get the first release out before IFComp 2013, but there were always new bugs to find or puzzles to touch up. I'd fix an area, then move to the next, then be sure the area was paved over smoothly--only to find several 'I saw that, right?' issues. The thing was, there was so much I needed to do, I couldn't get down to the fun aesthetic stuff in good conscience. Eventually I decided on a drop-dead release date early in 2014, but unfortunately I couldn't get to some good transcripts. I left some huge bugs in--ones my testers found--but release 2 made a lot more sense."
"Part eleven: nerve leapt. Vent. Repeal[paragraph break]One of the huge problems I had with testing was the inefficiency of adding one anagram. But with the major issues out of the way, I found ways to do stuff better. How to add names to anagram checking. This caused my bookshelf to add 1000 titles for release 3 and let me name all the authors. I found a way to centralize all the anagram tables so you could see them at the end. I thought I wouldn't use it much, but I wound up adding ten tables more. I used Notepad++ to load quickly and add anagrams when I didn't need to compile, and for my own vanity, I tracked the number of anagrams in the randomized tables and even checked if they conformed to Benford's Law and Zipf's Law. I wrote an anagram-checker. PERL even helped me to detect bad punctuation, capitals or quotes. All this helped me focus on technical stuff. There's so much I thought I'd only use once, but I reused it. All sorts of internal checks (like the table of anagrams and David White's hashes--in some cases, I wasn't checking right) cleared up. The Table of Nudges grew by several hundreds as I wrote a program to check for the hash value and dump it in a text file for later use. I even managed to write a silly program to check the relative difficulties of the areas. Towers is, by far, the toughest. But I think the most important thing I did was to try and play through one or two areas seriously per week. I needed to let testers['] suggestions soak in. Some puzzles, I thought, weren't perfect, but I didn't have better. But I would up cleaning them up later."
"Part twelve: twerp valet varlet wept[paragraph break]It turns out there's nothing here that was any good, but I liked this sentence."
"Part thirteen: inert? Phatter! Prettier than...[paragraph break]Just having time pass and being able to tighten up puzzles and think of things has been revealing. I write down my notes, look them over, and get on with it. I've never worked as hard at a creative project as I did with this game, but so many times I thought I'd run out of things to do before finding one more. While I figured 'Demo dome mode' shortly before release 2, I never got around to it because there was always something else in the game."
"Final part: plan a rift[paragraph break]I'll have to move on. I had fun with this game as a thought experiment. I enjoyed looking at a phrase, saying I bet that'll anagram, and being right. I also enjoyed finding that a simple anagram could fit nicely in the game's flow. But it all has a diminishing return to scale. I want to move on, but hopefully I'll be able to add new silly books or dialogue when there's enough. Oh, and if people find bugs (still) I can roll that up, too."

"A chunk of code starting with CheckTranscriptStatus notes how the author was able to nag his testers to take a transcript if they left a comment without transcripting on--or to thank them."
"You read various testing commands used in writing the game, including ones to show the exits every move, hint everything visible every move, and track hints without spoiling things for the player. Other commands include jumping to the Strip of Profits, clearing all but Otters, and even jumping to just before the Gates Stage."
"You stare at the start of the Table of Nudges. It's really big! Like, [number of rows in table of nudges] big! That's over double Shuffling Around! The numbers look confusing and arbitrary, but you recognize the anagram-strings that the game checks for, as well as how room anagrams seem to point to the same error messages."
"You stare at the start of the Table of Random Books. Wow, [number of rows in table of random books]! That's a lot of books! The second column seems to give a book a priority, so the player is likely to see certain ones first. Those seem to cover certain puzzles that occur later."
"You see some specialized Inform 6 code from Andrew Plotkin, Climbing Stars (for disabling TRACE for the Oyster puzzle, and for restarting the game after winning) and other people."
"You see a bit more Inform 6 code the author scratched out himself. The main chunk is at https://www.intfic.com/t/i6-stubs-for-i7-programmers/83/6."
"You read more various miscellaneous testing commands, like ones that zap all the guardians, see all the fruits or even show what the player would've missed or alternat paths every move."

"There's a reference to http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=17095 which describes how to detect orphan text in Inform source."
"The perl code is a bit complex, but it involves splitting a string in two, then assigning each a value. Manage, for instance, is 20001010000011000000000000. Mega Game is 30003030000030000000000000, which gets simplified to 1's. It looks like this piece of code detects if two strings are anagrams. There's commentary below."
"In particular, the code seems to account for if the book titles and the author names are anagrams. A note below mentions about 70% had matching names before the try, and 10% just had bad anagrams, before that was all fixed. And many former author names were shipped off to Shuffling Around to make room for new ones here."
"There's simpler code below just detecting if any anagrams are found in table entries. It's tough to follow, with exceptions for if two of the same word are in an entry, with the same hash as above."

table of observations
obser [from chic loner chronicle]
"I found so many ridiculous anagrams just reading a book on the way to work, or working out, and then I'd just feed them into the anagram server. If ten thousand seems like a lot, well, that is over two years, so that is fifteen per day. That is not so bad when you consider one takes a minute, and I can waste a lot of time in any case."
"A simple I <3 BLOCKSITE FOR FIREFOX. Well, that's not very philosophical or motivational, but it could be practical."
"It's difficult to describe when an idea has critical weight to branch out. For things like the responses to waiting or blank commands, I maybe had a few in one of/or loops, until I sat down and concentrated on words that meant doing nothing. It took a while to find, but once I had, say, six, I sat down and tried to stretch it to ten, when I put it in a table for the player to see at the end."
"Many of my ideas come from everyday things. I didn't pay religious attention to my file of anagrams once I put down the initial puzzles. However, having two testers say, this seemed a bit wobbly, got me thinking. There were puzzles I liked, and I recruited the best talent available, so to speak. But like on a sports team, the most impressive athlete doesn't necessarily fit. It was hard to retire favorite anagrams or demote them, but it was necessary. And I got some good mileage with ones I'd passed up because I thought I had enough good ones. The diners in release 3 are probably the best example of this."
"It wasn't until I established an assembly line for writing things up that I really started getting the anagrams in place. Before, I sent things to my daily writing, which sorted ideas to a big file by region. Once I cemented ARO as a big project to dedicate time to directly, I didn't have that hurdle, and things went faster."
"I'm still amazed how much organization helped me. Before, I might see an anagram and wonder where it went. Once I organized the anagram types into the Table of Megachatter, it became a lot clearer what would go where, and I could add a new category if I wanted. The one of/or constructions--where things cycled every three times you observed--billowed out to tables. I figured how to make a final note, too, before cycling."
"Once the anagrams started flowing, and I started adding alternate solutions, ARO started taking a long time to compile. Like 30 seconds. So I tried to place in random text and so forth while I built, since that was low-risk for recompiling. I had one rather bad bug which the Inform 6.32 compiler didn't track (http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXcompilersXinform6Xexecutables.html got the new version) but mostly it was just a matter of writing stuff down and feeding it to a computer. It was much more fun procrastination than others."
"Many of the puzzles just didn't make sense in the first version. But I was able to sort them out by ones that needed to be changed and ones that would be nice to. I found a lot of times I had to let a tester's observation sit for about two weeks before changing something: gee, it'd be nice to..."
"Perhaps the last thing I enjoyed looking up was that my data roughly obeyed both Zipf's and Benford's Law. I put the megachatter table rows and byte totals as data points into a graph at http://benford.jplusplus.org/, and while each looked pretty good by itself, together they gave a very low z-statistic. Zipf's law was a little trickier--the upper and lower halves of the data had different trend lines. I impart this to how I just sort of added a bunch of tables late, so of course thouse would sink to the bottom. While a few later tables gained traction (posse bosses, lame talk shows and comedians,) many were just neat to get to ten, and I didn't add to them."

a-text of coal is "RYRY". b-text of coal is "PGRY".

the fizzy cola is a singular-named thing. description is "The mug it's in seems to make it is more than usual, too. Cool.". the indefinite article of fizzy cola is "some"

Instead of taking the fount:

description of fount is "It's relaxing to look at, even if it isn't running. Perhaps it was a fount of knowledge, and knowledge was just too dry for the water that was in it."

the futon is a thing. description is "It doesn't have any brand name like [randbla]. [unless cpuready]Like most futons, it's unsoft.
