section deciding how to weight rules

[this is the random rule to decide which of 2 tables we choose if, say, examining the catechism]

weighted is a truth state that varies. weighted is usually false.

to decide whether go-with-first of (t1 - a table name) and (t2 - a table name):
	choose row with mytab of t1 in table of megachatter;
	let n1 be curidx entry;
	let n2 be maxidx entry;
	choose row with mytab of t2 in table of megachatter;

	if weighted is false:
		now n2 is 1;
		now m2 is 1;
	if n1 is 0 or n1 is 1:
		if m1 > 1: [this is not perfect but basically the larger tables come first]
			decide no; [this lets the 2nd bit cycle]
	d "[t1] vs [t2] is [n1] vs [m1] and [n1] * [m2] = [n1 * m2] vs [m1] * [n2] = [n2 * m1]. Also n1=[n1] vs m1=[m1].";
	if n1 * m2 <= n2 * m1:
		decide yes;
