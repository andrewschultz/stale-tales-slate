You can figure out what the settler does by talking to Elmo. But what if you do not get that far, or you want to skip over it? I hope this clarifies the hard work of what to do with the settler. This document will help with that, as well as with other things. Much of the logic isn't trivial, and it confused enough intelligent players and testers that I wanted to spell out all I could. I hope it answers your questions, but if not, email me (urglecrunheonblay@ailgmay.omcay), and I can add clarification. I also wrote out the Volt Maze in its own section, since it is probably the trickiest blocker puzzle in the whole game, but it is logically reducible with the clues, if you notice them all. Or you can just eat the crust!

<p>
I will try to give a logical way through the settler, which expands on what Elmo has to say and shows how you can figure out what the colors mean before you can get there.
<p>
<center><font size=+5><a name="fig">FIGURING THE SETTLER</a></font></center>
The tables are the first to look at. If you scan it, that gives RRYRRY in cheat and non-cheat mode. You can figure what the tables are by noting ablest bleats are in red. That actually leaves only 21 possibilities. Noting LabSet and BeLast, that cuts it down to 7.  The third time you examine them, eBlast technologies forces things into STABLE. That means STBL are red, AE are yellow.
<p>
If you look at the diorama, you will see that the event map, pavement, platform and farm plot all have RYRY in them in cheat and non-cheat modes. That means now FLMNPRTV are red, and AEO are yellow. Perhaps you see something important developing here.
<p>
Let's look at the non-cheat versions of other things, if you need a hint. Specifically, the rest of the diorama.
<p>
Brass crag <=> crabgrass leaves BCGRS as red and A as yellow. 
<p>
Pedestal <=> steel pad leaves DLPST/AE.
<p>
You may notice the * means a space. Or the game should tell you that.
<p>
So BCDFGLMNPRSTV are red and AEO are yellow. I think there's enough empirical evidence to say red=consonants and yellow=vowels.
<p>
If you turn cheats on, you can note pedestal <=> steel pad changes. It has two greens, at the "e" and "a" positions. It's not the letters themselves--but rather if they are the right letters.
<p>
Similarly for the brass crag and crabgrass, r and a are changed--purple and green--but they do not change places. That means purple = red + the right position.
<p>
You can also scan the satchel/latches in cheat mode for a huge clue.
<p>
But wait. My Niche has RRYRRYO in both modes. What is orange? Maybe you can guess, knowing vowels are yellow and consonants are red and--is Y a vowel or consonant?
<p>
Well, it depends--so you may guess Y is both, or a combination of red and yellow, or orange!
<p>
You can also see Yorpwald/Wordplay on the back of the Settler to see that d->y is orange and w->y is orange.
<p>
So MY NICHE becomes **(IE)**(IE)Y. If you listen to "my niche," you hear an ice hymn. Which leaves you seeing red. This means letter 3 is not e but i.
<p>
**i**ey and you can probably work on the first two letters. (chn)m and (chm)n can be eliminated pretty quickly, and *hi -> chi.
<p>
CHI**EY = chimney. We had to use a bit of deduction to knock this off, but not much.
<p>
The giant pin is a last lousy point, but you can determine a lot from it in cheat mode. In particular, vowels are a or i but are all wrong in 'giant pin,' so you get
<p>
*AINTI**, and that leaves six possibilities--3 if you note G first and N last can't work. Yup, PAINTING.
<p>
The Ten Beams don't give any positive hints, and I'm sorry, I tried, but I couldn't find anything else to make you see red.
<p>
Still, let's look at the TEN BEAMS.
<p>
The A-E-E must be in 2-4-6, and A cannot be in 6 and E cannot be in 2. The duplicate letters make it a bit easier, since E not being in 2 means A is there, so E is in 4 and 6.
<p>
That leaves the others. Again, this is the sort of thing that I hope is semi-intuitive and fun (e.g. what room do you go down to in a house?) and it's the only technically "unfair" puzzle. But the other ways through are not too bad, and the trade-off between one hard puzzle versus two easier should be okay.
<p>
For instance, the PRAM in the Highest Heights is also not bad.
<p>
<font face="courier new"> &nbsp;1 2 3 4
<br>r . x . .
<br>a x + x x
<br>m . x . x
<br>p x x . .</font>
<p>
Either settler setting gives A in position 2. You may or may not need the clue that follows. You could just note nothing with MA-- makes sense, thus giving RAMP, or you can refer to Mr. Pa being all wrong due to you seeing red, and that forces which letters go where.
<p>
<!-- logic for plates -->
The plaster gives you **A**ER, the plates **A**E (since there is just one vowel left) and some guesses can help you narrow down the plates, e.g. pleats or pastel. The first two letters can, in any case, give a huge clue as to what the word should be. They clog a bit unless you have ST. That leaves STAPLE.
<p>
Now the plates and plaster seemed to fit together. What does a staple go in? A STAPLER.
<p>
Elmo's final hint is that rifle is red. Irelf-Efril is a bit contrived, but it gives the full answer. You can also scan the rifle to give
<p>
fl/rfl/ie/ie/rfl. This doesn't reduce things much if you know the rifle's red, but it helps.
<p>
Irelf leads to fl/fl/IE/lr or fl-fl-IER. Flier.
<p>
This is the basic logic. However, there's still a question of what happens when the settler turns up a question mark.
<p>
<center><font size=+5><a name="qm">CHEAT MODE QUESTION MARKS</a></font></center>
<p>
In most any case, the question mark is more helpful than a red or yellow. It may seem ambiguous in cheat mode, because an already anagrammed thing may give contradictory readings. But, in fact, the way it works is often that two anagram readings clash. Therefore, one of the two is right, and one is wrong. If you know the ? must be, say, a vowel, and two clues are a vowel and consonant--the right letter must be the vowel! Or you'd get a red/yellow reading.
<p>
HINT QUESTION MARK details things, but I want to give an abstract and artificial example. So here goes something contrived: say you hear a Noser Snore and scan, and you get ?YRY?.
<p>
You can determine the two ?'s must be N-or-S and R-or-E. But actually, you can do even better. Noser/Snore have three consonants and two vowels, so the ?'s are both consonants! That leaves the last letter as an R. Sadly, we get no further help with the first letter, but an RYRY left means just four possibilities, even if you don't notice what you can eliminate. #2 can't be O, since otherwise, Noser Snore wouldn't be a straight yellow. Similarly for #4 and E. #3 can't be S. You are done: SENOR.
<p>
Note that the game has some four-letter puzzles like this, where (word1) (word2) pops up a lot of question marks. This ambiguity only slightly offsets knowing about a green or purple, especially if you scan out of cheat mode.
<center><font size=+5><a name="intro">INTRO</a></font></center>
<p>
The first time you can see this in the game is with the pastel plates. So let's break down what to do.
<p>
Palest Pastel Plates = RR?RRY. Since the final word has two vowels, the second letter must be a vowel, and it switches between yellow and green. So one of L, S or A is right. A is the vowel. That leaves xxAxxE, since there is only one other vowel. From there, you can eliminate anything starting with L or T as the consonants get gummed up. S, then, leaves STAPLE, SPALTE, STALPE. EPSTLA kills this off.
<p>
The Tropes Poster in the Strip of Profits is the second example.
<p>
<center><font size=+5><a name="stores">STORES</a></font></center>
<p>
<!-- logic for tropes poster -->
So, yeah, the Tropes Poster messes the settler up a bit. OR DOES IT (couldn't resist that trope. Or meme. Or whatever.)
<p>
??YRRY and what do the ?'s mean? First, we see vowels are in slots 3 and 6. That means consonants are in slot 1 and 2.
<p>
Now if T and P both gave the same result, the first ? would be red. But they do not. So it must be that one of T and P is right, since they both can't be.
<p>
Similarly, one of R and O is right. But O being right would mean 3 vowels in the magic word, which doesn't work.
<p>
(tp)R(eo)--(eo) -- but wait! O can't be in 3 since that is yellow. Also, we can eliminate p and t from slot 4 since that's a red.
<p>
(tp)RES(tp)O
<p>
TRESPO? Nah, PRESTO.
<p>
<center><font size=+5><a name="oyster">OYSTER</a></font></center>
<p>
<!-- logic for perma-amper -->
Another question mark pops up in the Posh Hops Shop. A few puzzles here are a bit easier, but let's go with it. The <b>Perma-Amper</b> shows you R?RYR in cheat mode.
<p>
There must be a vowel at location 2. But the settler can't decide what it should be. It has to be E or M, or the settler would not be confused. It would say Y. Since only E is a vowel, location 2 is E. That makes 4 A.
<p>
That leaves (rm)E(m)A(mp) if we eliminate the consonants, or REMAP. Note this isn't too hard without figuring what the ?'s are for, but if you get it anyway, you may be able to look back and see why the question mark is there.
<p>
<!-- logic for gins sign -->
Similarly, the <b>Gins Sign</b> gives clues-that-don't-seem-like-clues. In fact, it may be even easier.
<p>
?G?R means that you have -I-(G since s/n can't work). That means (sg)-I-(gn)-G is what's left. Oops. The g's can be crossed off, leaving SING.
<p>
<!-- logic for casper -->
Let's also take the example of <b>Casper Spacer</b>. He gives, in cheat mode,
<p>
?RRYRY. Now we can see from non-cheat mode that the first letter is a consonant--or we can see that it is a consonant by process of elimination, as we already have three of four consonants and two of two vowels.
<p>
The settler can't decide what to do with Casper Spacer, so maybe it doesn't know whether to act on Casper or Spacer. That means the results for Casper and Spacer are different at letter one--which means one of C and one of S must be right at first! This actually cuts a lot down, but there's another clue, there.
<p>
<!-- logic for capers -->
CAPERS RECAPS gives RRR??Y. That means that one of the two of E and A is right. This isn't helpful on its own, since E and A are the only two possible values, but the red means that C and R are wrong, so the word we need starts with S. Also, one of R/P is right. 
<p>
S-?(ae)(rp)(ae)
<p>
But wait! The third letter can't be C or P, since the scan is always red, and it can't be S since the first letter is. So, it's R. That means letter 5 is P, and 2 is C.
<p>
SCR-P- and SCRAPE is a word while SCREPA isn't.
<p>
<!-- logic for span pans -->
The <b>span pans</b> give a double-clue, too, and even if they seem a bit confusing, you can work things out pretty quickly.
<p>
SPAN/PANS to xxxx = ?R?R. Now the vowel has to be in the third place, since one of S and P must be in the first.
<p>
xxAx remains. But P must be in the fourth place, since it can't be N or S, and then the first place must be S. So, SNAP.
<p>
<!-- logic for plains -->
The plains also present a logic problem. If you scan there, you get a few question marks. How to get this LLP? IN and NS each have one letter in the final right word, and since we need one more vowel, I is right. That leaves A as the other vowel. ---AI-. But then the only first two letters can be N and S, and NP/NS clogs, so the first letter is S. If the second letter is N, SNLAIP doesn't make much sense, and thus SP(NL)AI(LN) makes SPLAIN the easy choice.
<p>
<!-- logic for Achers' Arches -->
The Achers' Arches are a bit tricky--note that if you examine them, they could be Chaser Arches. That gibes with the settler.
<p>
RY?RRR means that the ? is a vowel, so E or A must be right. However, chaser/achers/arches gives only an A, C or H in the third slot, so A it is...leaving the E for the other yellow.
<p>
-EA---. Since achers, arches and chaser all go red (except for chaser's a) you don't have many possibilities. R or H in the first slot give REACSH/HEARSC and then SEA forces an R in slot 4. SEARHC is not a word but SEARCH is.
<p>
<!-- logic for gleaner -->
The <b>general gleaner</b> is another, tougher example. It has ???(ea)(nr)??. That cuts things down a bit. You may notice the clue that it alternates yellow/purple and green/red. That means it is e-n or a-r, or the green/red would be coupled wrong.
<p>
So, ???(en/ar)?? and if you assume AR, the other vowels must be E, giving E??AR?E. LNG are the consonants, and you can wipe a bit out. E(ng)(lg)AR(lng)E is left and you can guess ENLARGE.
<p>
???EN?? leaves a bit of a mess, though, and in this case, reading that Al Green made the gleaner eliminates things more logically.
<p>
<!-- logic for papery yapper -->
Finally, there is the <b>Papery Yapper</b>. You can make some hay with "Rap, yep" in red--and even "ya perp"--but let's use the questions. Note that using Teach mode gives an immediate boost as it tells you where the Y is.
<p>
?RY?Y? for papery and yapper. The missing things are the y and two consonants, since we have a vowel and two consonant places set.
<p>
Let's look at place #4. It has either e or p right. But the two vowel places are set, so P is right. #5 cannot have R or E but needs a vowel, so it is A.
<p>
(PY) red yellow P A (YR) is left. Ugh--sorry for the notation here. R and Y clash too much with Papery.
<p>
But the yellow must be E, That leaves two possibilities for the consonant in slot 2: P or R. They logically force the other letters like so:
<p>
p -> ypepar
r -> prepay
<p>
<center><font size=+5><a name="troves">TROVES</a></font></center>
<p>
A few clues mess up the settler in cheat mode as three of the letters may or may not be right. Even so, you can switch to non-cheat, or use reasoning.
<p>
<!-- logic for pa egg pea -->
First, <b>Pa Egg Pea</b> gives ??R?. But it's about and by its author, <b>Peg A. Page</b>. That suggests the book is wrapped up in those four letters. The book is designed with "egg" split mid-word to give a 4x4 of author and book name. So the ? means one letter is right.
<font face="courier new">PAEG
<br>GPEA
<br>PEGA
<br>PAGE</font>
<p>
The red that can't be G must be P.
<p>The first letter is P or G, meaning G.
<p>
That leaves GEPA and GAPE. GAPE.
<p>
<!-- logic for sob ever verbose -->
The <b>sob ever verbose</b> gives YRR?RR?. Since it has three vowels, the question marks must both be vowels, and the vowels must both be right.
<p>
So then you have all the vowels: O--E--E. The sob itself knocks out a few possibilities, but if you listen a bit, more fall until you have OBSERVE.
<p>
<!-- logic for stop post -->
The <b>stop post</b> gives ?R??. That means we have
<p>
(sp)(sp)(op)(pt). That puts o in position 3 and t in position 4.
<p>
(sp)(sp)OT doesn't clear everything, but PSOT can be rejected. SPOT.
<p>
<!-- logic for ME ARTS -->
The ME ARTS has a big long name. MREAST STREAM TAMERS. The two question marks seem like a problem but aren't really. One must be a consonant, and one must be a vowel. But note the first one has only consonants as guesses, and one must be right, so the second is a vowel. The only vowel that could match up is A. That makes slot 5 E.
<p>-A--E- is left, but the last consonant can't be M/S/T so it is R. The second (slot 3) can't be M, and slot 4 can't be R. This isn't a big help, but with fewer than six possibilities left, you can guess around and get MASTER.
<p>
<!-- logic for bortles lobster -->
There are a lot of question marks for the Bortles Lobster, but the whole readout is ?GR??G? leaving only consonants.
<p>
(BL)O(LST)(ST)(LT)E(RS) is left. Slot 1 must have B, and slot 7 must have R.
<p>
<!-- logic for Sister Tressi Siters -->
Sister Tressi gives a couple question marks, but with all the vowels accounted for, we know the remaining slots must be consonants. In fact, the second being a yellow/vowel and not I means it's an E, and thus the other vowel is an I. Also, R is the only possible consonant in slot 1. RE-I--. Here we see that slot 3 is s or 3, and slot 5 is s or e. So they're both S, and slot 6 is T. RESIST.
<p>
<!-- logic for Marble Blamer Balmer -->
Blamer Balmer has just one question mark. So he's not too tough to figure out. R?RRRY means that the second slot is a vowel, one of A and L, so A. That means slot 6 is E. The red Mr. Beal and LeBram clues should clinch that the verb is RAMBLE.
<p>
<!-- logic for lead -->
For <b>LEAD</b>, by the two authors, ???R looks painful indeed. But the red means a consonant which can't be D. So it's L. Fortunately, there are just three choices.
<p>
?A?L -> EADL
A??L -> AEDL
<p>
So, ??AL = DEAL. You could, of course, use non-teach mode to knock this off. It'd give D**L.
<p>
<!-- logic for praise -->
The praise gives what appear to be funky results. Three question marks! But apparently it is the content of the praise that is throwing the questions: SPAREI/APESIR/PRAISE/IREAPS/IRESAP. Also, you may note that three consonants are defined, meaning the question marks are all vowels. But let's nail down the consonants first:
<p>
Slot 2 cannot be P or R, so it's S. We can't get any information for slot 3, since only vowels appear there in the praise. Slot 5 cannot be S or P, so it's R. That means 3 must be P: ?SP?R?.
<p>
Now the remaining slots must be vowels, so (ai)SP(ai)R(ie), since one of the vowels in each slot must be right. But then slot 6 is the only one that can be E, leaving ISPARE or ASPIRE. ASPIRE.
<p>
<!-- logic for salt -->
Next, there's the St. Al Salt. You could probably guess this, but let's go through the logical hoops anyway.
<p>ST AL and SALT give R?R?. That looks ambiguous, but if A is not in the first question mark, there is no A in the final word. So we have ?A??. If L is letter 4, T must be first. TASL. That doesn't work, so with T there, L must be first. LAST.
<p>
<!-- logic for trance nectar -->
Finally, the trance nectar is tricky. R??YRR. There are two possibilities here: the e-2 is right, or the a-3 is right. a-3 means r-2 is right, so that leaves C in the first place. So you have CRAE(TN/NT), which is not a word. But -EC--- leads to -ECA--, or RECA--, which must have T in the final slot. RECANT.
<center><font size=+5><a name="presto">PRESTO</a></font></center>
<p>
<!-- logic for sport ports -->
The Sport Ports seem to give a huge mess, but actually, they work out okay if you poke at the details. ?R?R?. But looking at the undefined slots, only one could be a vowel: slot 3. Therefore, we have --O--. But from here, we have a lot of possibilities canceling out, due to the question marks.
<p>(SP)(SRT)O(SP)(ST) is what is left. Now only slot 2 can be R, and once we know that, only slot 5 can be T. -RO-T. Now PROST is more likely than SROPT, but also, if you noticed STROP gave red text, you'd have things figured out there.
<p>
<!-- logic for alert -->
The ALERT/ALTER sign is not too bad if you see how to finagle it.
<p>
RY??? and if E is second, we have
<p>
? ? (ET) (RE) (TR) which means that A and L can't be in 3-5 so they are in 1-2. That means LA (ET) (RE) (TR) or LATER/LAERT. Clearly, LATER.
<p>
<!-- logic for hawt thaw -->
The hawt thaw seems to be trolling you a bit if you use cheat mode. Three question marks! But the one red letter you see is a big enough clue to get things rolling.
<p>
The first character can't be H or T, but it's a consonant, so it's W. Then, since one of the characters in each slot for hawt/thaw must be right, we have...
<p>
W(ah)(wa)(tw), and since W is already used, that gives W(ah)AT, or WHAT. If you had used non-cheat, it would have shown where the A was, which would be an immediate hint but would not have spoiled everything.
<p>
<!-- logic for usb -->
The USB is a bit different. It's only one word, so why the question mark? You can brute-force the possibilities.
<p>
<ul>
<li>BSU = no, vowel in 2nd position
<li>BUS = possible, and a word
<li>SBU = no, vowel in 2nd position
<li>SUB = possible, and a word
<li>UBS = would have purple-1
<li>USB = what it is
</ul>
<p>
So the settler can't determine if the B is right (SUB) or wrong (BUS.)
<p>
<center><font size=+5><a name="routes">ROUTES</a></font></center>
<p>
<!-- logic for rude 'n nuder -->
Rude 'N Nuder gives YRPG? when you have cheat on. That makes
<p>
(u or e) (d, r or n) D E (n or r)
<p>
This is not bad at all. 1 must be u. 2-5 must be R or N. So, URDEN or UNDER = UNDER.
<p>
<!-- logic for morf form -->
The MORF-FORM gives ?RY?, and the yellow must be O. But the first and last must be F or M each, making the second character R. That leaves FROM or MROF. FROM.
<p>
<!-- logic for all noon gag -->
Four question marks with a Y in the center look pretty rough, but actually, you can (almost) nail this one on logic alone.
<br>ALLNO
<br>ONGAG
<br>??Y??
<br>(AO)(LN)(AO)(AN)(OG) is what you get. But only 1 and 3 can be A and O, so that makes 4 and 5 N and G, respectively. Then 2 must be L. ONALG or ALONG are the only two left.
<p>
<!-- logic for thickness sketchins -->
Logan's poem on the Cripple Clipper may be confusing, too,but let's break it down.
<br>WHATTAR
<br>TAWRATH
<br>THATRAW
<br>ARTTHAW
<br>?RRR?RR
<br>Now it's frustrating to have two questions marks, but they must both be vowels. The only vowel is A, so ... A???A??. But with that information, T cannot be in slots 3, 4 or 6, pushing it to 2 and 7. AT--A-T. There are three choices left here, based on if slot 6 is H, R or W, and it turns out ATHWART works.
<p>
<center><font size=+5><a name="towers">TOWERS</a></font></center>
<p>
Some puzzles in the Towers are better solved by talking or getting "red" dialogue. But they also have their own odd solutions if you find the right trick.
<p>
<!-- logic for dreads adders -->
The Dreads Adders give RY?RYR. The question mark must be a consonant, or D. That's the only clue you can get from the question mark, but everything else must give a wrong answer. There are only six possibilities left, but the ED SARD red clue forces the D to the 4th spot, and since S can't be in 6, it's in 1. SEDDAR or SADDER is SADDER.
<p>
<!-- logic for snider diners -->
The snider diners are the next to pop up questions, though you may not need to use question marks' flexibility to deal with them.
<p>
There are question marks at locations 2, 3 and 5. What does this mean? It means 2 and 3 are I or N. 5 must be E or R. But if you switch to non-cheat mode, you get RYRRYR. That means #2 is a vowel and so is #5. That cuts down the possibilities some more.
<p>
-IN-E-. But now the red for Snider and Diners in position 1 means that it the consonant is not S or D. That leaves R. RIN-E-.
<p>
You can guess which of the two choices it is, but if we want to figure all the logic, snider's d at letter 4 or diners's s at letter 6 will eliminate RINDES. So, RINSED.
<p>
<!-- logic for bluster butlers -->
The Bluster Butlers give an odd readout.
<p>
R?RRR?? looks like garbage, but then there's only one consonant in the three question marks. It probably isn't in slot 2. That means that one of L or U must be slot 2, so, U. Then slot 6 is E/R and 7 is R/S. But we need the E somewhere, so we get -U---E(R/S). You can listen to the butlers, examine them or run past them to get other clues (TRUBLE'S, LES BURT, URL BEST), and since they could afford to be quieter, you may find SUBTLER anyway.
<p>
<!-- logic for docile old ice -->
The docile old ice gives one question mark in the second slot, so counting vowels and consonants, we note the question mark must be a vowel, or O. Everything else is a wrong letter. Examining twice reminds you of LIEDCO, which gives the only unique solution of COILED.
<p>
<!-- logic for muscly luc sym -->
Muscly Luc Sym only appears if you are male, but his question mark should be pretty clear. There is no O. So therefore, the Y must be at the end. From there you should be able to eliminate possibilities pretty easily. S in the first slot gives SMULCY/SLUMCY, so it's C. Then CMULSY and CSULMY aren't words, so, clumsy.
<p>
<!-- logic for fluster self rut -->
The fluster self rut is not too bad even without the red text. R?RRR?R leaves only vowels in the question mark spots. The first is L or E, the second L or U. That makes -E---U-. But now we can cut out a lot of red text. TRU-SELF and FURLETS leave only two possibilities, or you can note that L leaves garbled text in the middle. RE---U-. Brute force with L and F in the third spot can give RES--U-, then REST-U- (t can't go anywhere else) and RESTFUL.
<p>
<!-- logic for natives -->
The natives may be a bit confusing. They have two solutions. Here, you may have to listen to the places they know, and things will become clear. All the clues, cycling, will force you logically into
<p>
-AI-EST, or NAIVEST or VAINEST.
<p>
You could, of course, cheat up a bit by assuming that the ? was purple and thus N. That'd start you with NA (ie) (vst) (ie) (vst) (vst) and not much left to choose.
<p>
<!-- logic for mardier admirer -->
This one is a bit weird. Four question marks! Fortunately, we can focus on the first two entries, which could be A ... or not. Both can't be A, since there's only one A in mardier and admirer. If both were consonants, then MD----- puts R in slot 3 since that is R or M. That creates a problem for slot 7, which must be R, but it's already disqualified by the settler's last color: r gives red.
<p>
So that means our word starts MA or AD. Also, that means slot 5 must be the remaining vowel, since slot 3 is either R or M and definitely a consonant. Since E is in slot 6, slot 5 is I.
<p>
----IE- looks horrible, but in fact it is not bad. Assume it starts AD. Then AD--IE- leads to ADRRIE- since we need to place 2 R's but not in slot 7. ADRRIEM is not a word, then. MA--IE- gives us better luck. The missing consonant in slot 3 is M or R, but since M was used, it's R. Slot 4 cannot be D, and since M was used, it is the other R. That leaves D for slot 7. MARRIED.
<p>
<!-- logic for angriest ingrates -->
The ingrates fall a bit more easily than you'd expect, and the purples on the settler help a lot. The question marks in ?PPRRY?R both have to be vowels. But which ones? The second must be E. The first can be A or I, but the yellow can be A or I too. That leaves (AI)NG(ST)(ST)(AI)ER, since the red in the eighth place cuts things down. Of these four combinations, only ANGSTIER makes sense.
<p>
<!-- logic for resident trendies -->
The RESIDENT TRENDIES are sort of tricky. They give R?RRY?R?. But the final letter must be a consonant, making the other two vowels. That meaks the second digit must be a vowel, or E. Now, there's still some listening you can do, or you can note that it's likely for an adjective to end in ST, so (DN)(IE)(DRN)(DR)(IE)EST would result, and of the six ties left, NERDIEST fits. This is a bit tricky with just the settler, but the listening clues should help.
<p>
The grailman and the wait-seer also both pop up question marks. Here, this doesn't solve what they are, but it helps.
<p>
<!-- logic for alarming grailman -->
RYRRYR?R = alarming grailman
<p>
So N and A are causing the conflict. But one must be right! Which one? Well, there are 3 vowels but only two yellow/greens so far. So the right letter is a vowel. A.
<p>
-(ai)--(ai)-A- is what you get. This leaves you a bit away from the solution, and in fact knowing his name is Liam Garn in red (along with a non-cheat scan) actually knocks out the vowels on its own, but this is a pretty good start, I hope. And a reminder the settler isn't everything!
<p>
<!-- logic for sweatier wait-seer -->
The sweatier wait-seer is another matter.
<p>
?YYRY?RR =sweatier/wait-seer
<p>
So letter 1 is s or w, and letter 6 is i or e. So the settler alone is not a big help. TREES (AW I/I AW) (talk) and I WE STARE (examine) and EW I TEARS (attack) work better. But knowing R is not the first letter can help a bit.
<p>
<!-- logic for dandier arid den -->
The dandier arid den appears to give two annoying question marks to start in cheat mode. In normal mode, the endorsers should wrap things up, but cheat mode's two question marks make things fall out.
<p>??YYRGR means -----E-. But notice something: there are two known consonants and three known vowels. The remaining two spaces must be consonants, so A or D = D, and A or R = R. Well, that makes things easier! DR---E-. #3 can't be I, so it's A, leaving I for 4. DRAI-E-. But then D in 5 and N in 7 won't work. DRAINED.
<p>
<!-- logic for hostile-is-he lot -->
<p>Lois the Hostile and the Hostile-Is-He Lot each have their own wrinkles. The cheat settings help here, despite--or because of--the questions.
<p>The Hostile-Is-He Lot has ??RYYR?. Now this looks like a mess, until you realize that there must be two consonants and one vowel in the questions. So where are the consonants?
<p>If they're in the first two characters, then we have HS----E. That's a mess! The vowels must be I and O, in order, since letter 5 can't be O. That leaves HS(LT)IO(LT)E, or nonsense.
<p>But that means T is in the right place, and that also means that letter 3 can't be S or H so it's L. That's one letter down! Now, if we assume letter 2 is the consonant, the question mean ISL---T. ISLOEHT is it, because E can't be in slot 4. This doesn't make sense.
<p>HOL---T. The only consonant left is S, but then we can't have an E in slot 4, thus HOLIEST.
<p>
<!-- logic for lois the hostile -->
<p>Lois the Hostile also has a question mark to start. The -GRYYR means it starts with H or L, but the O must be right. I cannot be in slot 5, so it's E. (HL)O(HLT)IE(ST)(HLST).  We can eliminate what #7 should be pretty easily. H gives LOTIESH, L gives HOTIESL, and S gives (LH)O(LH)IETS which doesn't work, but HOLIEST does. You could also listen to what Lois is saying, to see red, to eliminate things quicker.
<p>
<!-- logic for asset-hit atheists -->
The asset-hit atheists are tricky. You can see the fifth entry must be a vowel, because the third and eighth must be consonants. That's a decent start, but the rest is tricky.
--(SH)-I--(ST). If you talk to them, "Set, it has" giving redness means the final entry must be T. With the settler and some educated guesses, not much is left.
<p>
<!-- logic for dinger -->
READING: A DINGER gives a couple question marks, but they must be vowels, to make three vowels total. That gives us --(AI)--E-, or filling in the final vowel, --(AI)(AI)-E-. This doesn't solve everything, but it does help you narrow down the first letter: N or D would clog with NG or DG, so G comes first. Then you can either look at the coauthors or note .....EN doesn't make a good adjective.
<p>
<!-- logic for raves saver -->
Now the raves saver is an odd one. The six letters are for "REPLAY PLAYER." But there are lots of ?'s.
<p>
This is one where having the non-cheat version shows a lot more. In fact it gives RYYRRO. That means that one of L and E is right in 2, as is one of P and A in 3. But 2/3 are vowels, so --EA-Y. Similarly, R or P is in 1, L can't be in 4, and that leaves two possibilities as L must then be 5. REAPLY/PEARLY. Pearly it is.
<p>
<!-- logic for weirder red wire -->
The last odd one this side of Leak Lake is the weirder red wire.
<p>Cheat mode gives ?E---?-, but since space 1 is R or W, and the remaining space we don't know must be a vowel, so it's E. That means the remaining vowel is E. -E-I-E-. Now 3 and 5 can't be D. That leaves 7 as D. -E-I-ED. There are only three possibilities here: RERIWED, WERIRED, REWIRED. So, yeah, REWIRED.
<p>
<!-- logic for sporties' ripostes -->
The sporties' ripostes are a bit different. Now, there are two vowels at positions 5 and 6, and one question mark. So that question mark must be an O. Six can't be I, so that leaves --O-IE--. Now, if you listen a lot, eliminating all the possibilities will lead to how to dispel the ripostes.
<p>Two S's are in places 2, 4 and 7. Now look at place #4. If it is P, then -SOPIES- with (RT) doesn't work. If it is T, -SOTIES- again doesn't work. So let's try R in 7. -SOSIER- also has P/T left, which means no sensible words. This, S must be in the 7th place and R is in the 2nd. -ROSIES- is PROSIEST.
<p>
<!-- logic for pester'n serpent -->
The pester'n serpent, which is optional, also pops up question marks. It's not necessary to win Towers, but with the question marks, it is not difficult, especially if you remember what it was called in version 1 or 2. The cheat-mode tells you where the e's are.
<p>
It also tells you that you have
<p>
(ps)(nprst)E(nrs)E(nr)(nt). Why? One of P and S must be right, or we'd have a red in 1. Similarly for N, R and 6 and N, T and 7.
<p>
From here, guesswork is not too bad. Let's say S is in the first slot. Then
<p>
S(nprt)E(nr)E(nr)(nt) becomes SPE(nr)E(nr)T, and spenert/sperent aren't quite words.
<p>
P(nrst)E(nrs)E(nr)(nt) is left. If we put N last, that forces PTESERN, not a word.
<p>
P(nrs)E(nrs)E(nr)T only has so many possibilities, but N in first gives PNESERT. S in first gives PSENERT or PSERENT. So we have PRESENT left.
<p>But there are two other things which give questions on cheat mode.
<!-- logic for tetris sitter -->
<p>The Tetris Sitter is one of them. It gives ?RYRRY. So the first letter must be T or S. But what of the others? The fourth slot cannot be R or T. That means it is S. But since the first letter is T or S, it must be T. But TT clogs things up, so it is TR-ST-. TRISTE is a word, TRESTI isn't.
<p>
<!-- logic for curst palace -->
The final puzzle is the Curst Palace, Castle Apcur. If you have the settler in cheat mode, you get a ? at the end. Which is annoying, but it isn't. Because if you put the settler in non-cheat mode, you see you need an R at the end. Since the ?'s blink alternately, then, you have
<p>
----T-----R
<p>
That doesn't clinch everything, but it makes it easier. Along with the items you find going in and out, you should wind up getting all the clues.
<p>
accurstleAp
<p>
clEarcatsup
<p>
pestacCruAl (this is the big one)
<p>
cactuspearl (may eliminate a few clues)
pearlcactus
accuplasteR (you may have the r, but if not, yay)
capsulecart
<p>
All of these together leave 24 possibilities. The final two, talC spa cure and last acre cup, cross off some semi-improbably ones and leave two possibilities. But by then you may know to look for superlatives anyway.
<p>

<!-- logic for bleary barley -->
The bleary barley is another example of the questions, but it turns out to be more straightforward.
<p>
P??YRB -- the B you may not have seen before, but it has to be brown based on the upper window. Brown = blue + orange.
<p>
B----Y and letter 2 is L or A, while letter 3 is E or R. You can use non-cheat mode to figure things out.
<p>
Or you can note that the red means r and e don't work in slot 5, but it must be a consonant, thus: L. Similarly, a and l don't work in slot 4, but we need a vowel. E.
<p>
B--ELY is BRAELY (nah) or --BARELY.
<p>
<!-- logic for cinders -->
The cinders are a bit odd, and they're meant to be a tricky LLP. There are two things you can do with them, hence the question marks. You may need a bit of word-logic here, but the R?RR??R leaves two vowels. If there is not a vowel in the second position, then we have clumping. So the question mark may force an I or an E, depending on what you can do. But you may also notice that one of the two verbs must have E in the fifth slot, putting I in the second.
<p>-I--E-- and with Sr Indec and Nrdices as clues, you can get close. The last lousy point is trickier, but once you know DISCERN, you know that all the question marks are because DISCERN is right. That gives you a few hints, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to give a full logical answer.
<p>
<!-- logic for formally -->
There are also a few problems with the Macks. "Fly Moral" and "A Folly Mr" reveal the question mark in slot 1 must be F, since there are two consonants unaccounted for. You can end with LY, so FO--A-LY is a start because O can't be in slot 5, and there are vowels at 2 5.
<p>
<!-- logic for steamily -->
The most detailed is May Islet Misty Ale, which allegedly does not taste like slimy tea. The cheat-mode gives ?RYYRY?O. Now both question marks must be a consonant since the three vowels and Y are accounted for. That means letter 7 can't be E, so it is L. You sort of knew that, based on the area's theme, but once you do, it leaves a lot of eliminations. You may also note that M(STL) clogs, so you can see what happens with S to start.
<p>
<!-- logic for tearily-irately -->
--(EA/AE)-ILY is left. That's only 12 possibilities--well, fewer, since 1 can't be T (one of M or S) and we can just go case by case. S=2 gives MS(AE/EA)T, a mess, and S=5 gives MT(AE/EA)S, another mess. So S is in slot 1. SMEATILY/SMAETILY is too slangy, so ST--MILY becomes STEAMILY.
<p>
<!-- logic for atmo-moat -->
You also probably don't need help with the atmo-moat, but let's go through the possibilities anyway.
<p>??YR means that you have O as the second vowel, since it can't be A. That means A has to be in the first two letters, or the first slot. You could also note that O is already taken, so the second letter can't be O. That leaves ATO?, or ATOM.
<center><font size=+5><a name="others">OTHERS</a></font></center>
<p>
<!-- logic for melon -->
The melon seems like it should not be that hard, but it pops up question marks even on non-cheat mode. What is going on is that, well, you need to talk to Len, and there are two ways to do it. The RYR??/????? suggests that a M, E and L work in some cases but not in others. You can say LEN, MO or MO, LEN to get the melon. While this is tricky, there are a lot of other ways to get points, so I hope it's not too disappointing that the settler conks out, especially since it is five letters.
<p>
<!-- logic for inapt paint -->
The inapt paint says DESERVER RESERVED. It has a lot of question marks, but all three vowels are green in cheat mode, and one consonant even works out, giving you
-E-ER-E-
<p>
(dr)E(sv)ER(sv)E(dr) is rather easy to sift through, since there are only four possibilities. REVERSED.
<p>
<!-- logic for coins -->
The (plain) coins near the end are, unavoidably, confusing. That's because they can, like the USB, get a description and become a thing which has no letters in common. In fact, the coins can become two very different things. Hence all the question marks. In this case, you may want to have scanned the coin beforehand, or take up the game's offer to scan a coin. Cheat mode should make it obvious what it should be: YRYP means (io)C(io)N or icon since i can't be in slot 3.
<p>
However, if you combine cheat and non-cheat mode, then you notice the fifth slot is the only fixed one. It is a consonant. That gives you the idea that the last letter must be S in one case and C in another, and what's more, the words share no other consonant/vowel space in common.
<p>
<!-- logic for sonic coins -->
That leaves only the sonic coins. YRY?? leaves two consonants. So one of I or N is the right consonant in slot 4: N. One of C or S is the right consonant in slot 5. And also, the vowel in slot 3 can't be i, so it is o. That leaves
<p>
I-ON-. ISONC? No. ICONS.
<p>
<center><font size=+5><a name="example">BIG EXAMPLE: VOLT MAZE</a></font></center>
<p>
The volt maze is probably the trickiest.
<p>
(Yo/Oy!) Congratulating yourself without going through is a clue...
<p>
First, what is a vowel and what is a consonant?
<p>
<font face="courier new">&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
<br>m . x . x . . x .
<br>a x . x . x x . x
<br>z . x . x . . x .
<br>e x . x . x x . x
<br>l . x . x . . x .
<br>t . x . x . . x .
<br>o x . x . x x . x
<br>v . x . x . . x .</font>
<p>
VOLT MAZE ditches some possibilities. As does VZT, Lame-O! if you touch something.
<p>
l-to-v maze is a big hint, too...but if you meet Lev Matzo, you get...
<p>
<font face="courier new">&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
<br>m . x . x x x x .
<br>a x . x . x x . x <- a = 2nd
<br>z . x . x . x x .
<br>e x x x . x x . x
<br>l x x x x . x x .
<br>t x x x x x + x x
<br>o x x x . x x . x
<br>v x x x x . x x .</font>
<p>
Now you have something neat to observe. The L/V and V/L and T leave the M/Z and 1/3.
<p>
This means if Z=5 or 8, M=1 or 3 and nothing = 3 or 1. Similarly for M=8.
<p>
<font face="courier new">&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
<br>m . x . x x x x x
<br>a x + x x x x x x
<br>z . x . x x x x x
<br>e x x x . x x . x
<br>l x x x x . x x .
<br>t x x x x x + x x
<br>o x x x . x x . x
<br>v x x x x . x x .</font>
<p>
Note this also makes (L,v) = (5,8). Thus (E,O) = (4,7) and you have 8 possibilities.
<p>
But Matzo Lev will break it wide open. Because you see M=1, E can't be 7 and V is 8.
<p>
Without the L/V jump you can see MZV which gives you Mazel Tov.
<p>
<font face="courier new">&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
