?Which puzzles are discussed here?
Only puzzles where the settler throws a question mark in cheat mode.
?What does a question mark in the settler reading mean?
It means that one of the letters in the description is right, but not all of them.
Sometimes this can really help you more than an actual reading, though occasionally it can muddle things.
?What are general strategies for dealing with question marks?
If there is only one, you know whether it is a vowel or a consonant, since you should know the number of vowels and consonants in the target word. You will be a vowel or consonant short.
If there is more than one, you may wish to check if there is a choice between only vowels or only consonants in any one slot. If so, then you may be able to determine what the other question-mark slots must be.
Or if, for instance, the target word has two vowels, and the settler gives no vowels and two question marks, both question marks must be a vowel.
These won't always get you to the right answer, but they'll often get you closer than even a standard cheat readout.

?What does _Pa Egg Pea_'s reading mean?
First, <b>Pa Egg Pea</b> gives ??R?. But it's about and by its author, <b>Peg A. Page</b>. That suggests the book is wrapped up in those four letters. The book is designed with "egg" split mid-word to give a 4x4 of author and book name. So the ? means one letter is right.
Here is how things look:\n<pre>PAEG\nGPEA\nPEGA\nPAGE</pre>
The third slot is red and can't be G, so it's P.
The first letter is P or G, meaning G.
That leaves GEPA and GAPE. GAPE.
?What about the Sob Ever Verbose?
The <b>sob ever verbose</b> gives YRR?RR?. Since it has three vowels, the question marks must both be vowels.
And in each slot, the only possible vowel is E. That means the other Y must be the final vowel, O.
With O--E--E, we have some tricky stuff with the consonants. But if we listen, we can hear some red stuff that is all wrong. That gives us OBSERVE.
?What about the stop post?
The <b>stop post</b> gives ?R??.
That makes the second slot S or P, since it can't be T or O.
But it does the same for the first: one of S or P must be right.
The third is O or S, and the fourth is P or T, but since the first and second can't be consonants, the third must be.
(SP)(SP)O(PT) is left. That means T must be in slot 4.
SPOT is right, and PSOT is not.
?How do I figure out Sister Tressi?
Sister Tressi gives a couple question marks, but with all the vowels accounted for, we know the remaining slots must be consonants.
In fact, the second being a yellow/vowel and not I means it's an E, and thus the other vowel is an I.
Also, R is the only possible consonant in slot 1. RE-I--.
Here we see that slot 3 is S or 3, and slot 5 is S or E. So they're both S, and slot 6 is T.
RESIST.
?How do I decipher the ME ARTS?
The ME ARTS has a big long name. MREAST STREAM TAMERS.
The two question marks seem like a problem but aren't really. One must be a consonant, and one must be a vowel.
But note the first one has only consonants as guesses, and one must be right, so the second is a vowel.
The only vowel that could match up in slot 2 is A. That makes slot 5 E.
-A--E- is left, but the last consonant can't be M/S/T, so it is R. The second (slot 3) can't be M, and slot 4 can't be R. This isn't a big help, but with fewer than six possibilities left, you can guess around and get MASTER.
?What about the BORTLES Lobster?
It gives ?GR??G?, which looks horrible...
...until you notice there are only two vowels, total. That gives -O---E-, and the rest are consonants.
In fact, each slot is one of two consonants.
(BL)O(LST)(TS)(LT)E(RS).
B must be in slot 1, R in slot 7. That leaves three possibilities based on what slot 3 is.
BOLSTER turns out to be the right one.
?How do I figure Blamer Balmer?
Blamer Balmer has just one question mark. So he's not too tough to figure out.
R?RRRY means that the second slot is a vowel, one of A and L, so A. That means slot 6 is E.
The red Mr. Beal and LeBram clues should clinch that the verb is RAMBLE.
?What do I do with _Lead_?
For <b>LEAD</b>, by the two authors, ???R looks painful indeed. But the red means a consonant which can't be D. So it's L. Fortunately, there are just three choices.
<pre>?A?L -> EADL\nA??L -> AEDL</pre>
So, ??AL = DEAL. You could, of course, use non-teach mode to knock this off. It'd put the consonants at the end and the vowels in the middle.
?What about the brochure in the Browse Bowers ("Sir Dee/Reside")?
A reading of the brochure gives R???RG.
We can get the first letter, then--consonant not R or S, so, D.
The second must be a vowel (I or E,) and the third must be a consonant, R or S. Therefore number four is a vowel.
Since the fourth slot is I or D, it is I, making the others E.
DE-I-E has two possibilities, so you can guess DESIRE.
?Finally, what about the Trance Nectar?
Well, the R??YRR leaves you with a couple possibities for the 2nd/3rd slot. One vowel, one consonant.
Here a minimal bit of guesswork and grinding it out works.
-RA--- would mean CRAE(NT/TN) as there's a vowel in the fourth slot, and the first can't be N/T or R. So that doesn't work.
-EC--- would mean RECA(NT/TN) or RECANT.
