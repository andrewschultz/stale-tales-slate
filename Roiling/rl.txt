>GENERAL
?Which puzzles are discussed here?
Only puzzles where the settler throws a question mark in cheat mode.
There's a brief recap of how to deal with the settler if it doesn't throw a question mark, but since the question mark may be confusing, I tried to break down how it actually helps you long-term once you know how to deal with it.
?Can I get a recap of the settler in general in non-cheat mode?
Yes. If you scan certain items and then see what they should be, you'll notice a pattern. There's some spoilers below, but if you track settler vs. the right word, you should see a pattern.
Yellow slots wind up as AEIOU: for instance, STABLE is RRYRRY.
Red is the rest...except Y, which is orange.
?Can I get a recap of the settler in general in cheat mode?
Yes. Colors can be red, yellow, purple, green, orange or brown.
In non-cheat mode, red is a consonant, and yellow is a vowel.
Purple and green are red and yellow, with blue.
If you look at the latches, they have green and purple except at the ends. SATCHEL is almost latches, with letters switched at the end.
So purple and green mean that a letter is in the right place.
Orange is a combination of red and yellow, or Y.
Brown (orange plus blue, roughly) is a Y in the right place.
?What are some general issues and terms?
Well, for starters, "clog" means too many consonants. "Bleed" means too many vowels in a row.
There'll also be some terminology and shorthand: EN(DT) means End or Ent, and I may use several parentheses in a row.
?What does a question mark in the settler reading mean?
It means that one of the letters in the description is right, but not all of them.
Sometimes this can really help you more than an actual reading, though occasionally it can muddle things.
?What are general strategies for dealing with question marks?
If there is only one, you know whether it is a vowel or a consonant, since you should know the number of vowels and consonants in the target word. You will be a vowel or consonant short.
If there is more than one, you may wish to check if there is a choice between only vowels or only consonants in any one slot. If so, then you may be able to determine what the other question-mark slots must be.
Or if, for instance, the target word has two vowels, and the settler gives no vowels and two question marks, both question marks must be a vowel.
Combining these observations may allow you to knock off several question marks right away. For instance, a R?RR with just one vowel means the second slot must be the only vowel in whatever two words clash.
These won't always get you to the right answer, but they'll often get you closer than even a standard cheat readout with just colors. But they may seem confusing at first.

# logic for plates
?How do I decode the palest pastel plates?
RR?RRY shows up. The question mark must be a vowel, since palest etc. have two vowels and four consonants. The only one that could fit is A. That leaves E in slot 6.
--A--E and now we can eliminate a few possibilities. The first letter can't be P, the second L, the fourth T and the sixth S. That's really not enough for a definitive guess, but if we look at what the first letter must be, L(PST) clogs, as does T(SP), so it has to be S. S(PT)A(LP)(LPT)E.
That leaves only a few choices we can brute-force. If slot 2 is P, SPALTE is not a word. So STA(LP)(LP)E = STAPLE.
>STRIP OF PROFITS
# logic for tropes poster
?How can we unlock the tropes poster and store p?
Well, you can scan store p, then the tropes poster, in order to circumvent the question marks. That's a big hint.
Or you can notice the first two question marks must be consonants. That's a big help. Slot 2 must be R or O, which means R.
Slot 3 is a vowel that is not O, so it's E, and slot 6 is a vowel, and O is the only remaining one.
But now slot 4 can't be P or T, and slot 2 covers R, so slot 4 is S.
(TP)RES(TP)O = PRESTO.
>STORE P
>>MARINES SEMINAR REMAINS
# logic for sport ports
?What do you say to the sport ports?
The Sport Ports seem to give a huge mess, but actually, they work out okay if you poke at the details. ?R?R?. But looking at the undefined slots, only one could be a vowel: slot 3, since slots 1 and 5 leave a choice between two consonants. Therefore, we have --O--.
But from here, we have a lot of possibilities canceling out, due to the question marks.
(SP)(SRT)O(SP)(ST) is what is left. Now only slot 2 can be R, and once we know that, only slot 5 can be T. -RO-T.
Now PROST is more likely than SROPT, but also, if you noticed STROP gave red text, you'd have things figured out there.
>>PHAT PATH
# logic for hawt thaw
?Is there a word to yell at the hawt thaw?
The hawt thaw is trolling you a bit if you use cheat mode. Three question marks! But the one red letter you see is a big enough clue to get things rolling.
So, R???. The first character can't be H or T, but it's a consonant, so it's W.
Then, since one of the characters in each slot for hawt/thaw must be right, we have...
W(ah)(wa)(tw), and since W is already used, that gives W(ah)AT, or WHAT.
If you had used non-cheat, it would have shown where the A was, which would be an immediate hint but would not have spoiled everything.
Also, I found it hard not to use "what" to start this question sequence, for obvious reasons.
# logic for alert
?What should I say to the ALERT/ALTER part of the sign?
You have RY???. The three question marks look troublesome, but since there are only two possibilities each, this gives...
RY (ET)(ER)(RT). That leaves L and A as the first two letters, so...
LA (ET)(ER)(RT). That leaves LAERT or LATER.
LATER.
>>HACKS' SHACK
#logic for usb
?Why does the USB give question marks?
That's because there are two solutions.
But since it's a three letter word, I didn't feel too guilty allowing for this.
The vowel in the middle leaves two possibilities.
You can leave via SUB or BUS.
>STORE U
>>SAME MESA
#logic for rude 'n nuder
?How do I decipher what to do with Rude 'N Nuder?
The YRPG? gives you a lot of clues. The question mark is a consonant, so it's N or R. The green is E, making the first letter U.
So, U--E(NR) has D in slot 3, and thus U(NR)DE(NR). URDEN is not a word, but UNDER is.
#logic for morf form
?What's with the morf form giving question marks?
The ?RY? notation shows where the vowel is: O is in the third slot. That's a start.
Similarly, slots 1 and 4 are F or M, leaving slot 2 as R.
FROM is more likely than MROF. So there you go.
>>HARMS MARSH
#logic for all noon gag
?What do we do with the all noon gag reading?
The ??Y?? looks intimidating, but the question marks give lots of clues:\n<pre>ALLNO\nONGAG\n??Y??</pre>
That leaves possibilities of (AO)(LN)(AO)(AN)(OG).
But only 1 and 3 can be A and O, so that makes 4 and 5 N and G, respectively.
Then 2 must be L. ONALG or ALONG are the only two left. ALONG is the only word of these two.
>>CRIPPLE CLIPPER
#logic for thickness sketchins
?What is with the thickness sketchins?
Logan's poem on the Cripple Clipper may be confusing, too,but let's break it down.
<pre>WHATTAR\nTAWRATH\nTHATRAW\nARTTHAW\n?RRR?RR</pre>
<br>Now it's frustrating to have two questions marks, but they must both be vowels. The only vowel is A, so ... A---A--.
But now we note there must be two T's, and T cannot be in slots 3, 4 or 6, pushing it to 2 and 7. AT--A-T.
There are three choices left here, based on if slot 6 is H, R or W, and it turns out ATHWART works.
>STORE V
>>LOATHER RATHOLE
# logic for pa egg pea
?What does _Pa Egg Pea_'s reading mean?
First, <b>Pa Egg Pea</b> gives ??R?. But it's about and by its author, <b>Peg A. Page</b>. That suggests the book is wrapped up in those four letters. The book is designed with "egg" split mid-word to give a 4x4 of author and book name. So the ? means one letter is right.
Here is how things look:\n<pre>PAEG\nGPEA\nPEGA\nPAGE</pre>
The third slot is red and can't be G, so it's P.
The first letter is P or G, meaning G.
That leaves GEPA and GAPE. GAPE.
>>BUSTLE SUBLET
# logic for sob ever verbose
?What about the Sob Ever Verbose?
The <b>sob ever verbose</b> gives YRR?RR?. Since it has three vowels, the question marks must both be vowels.
And in each slot, the only possible vowel is E. That means the other Y must be the final vowel, O.
With O--E--E, we have some tricky stuff with the consonants. But if we listen, we can hear some red stuff that is all wrong. That gives us OBSERVE.
# logic for stop post
?What about the stop post?
The <b>stop post</b> gives ?R??.
That makes the second slot S or P, since it can't be T or O.
But it does the same for the first: one of S or P must be right.
The third is O or S, and the fourth is P or T, but since the first and second can't be consonants, the third must be.
(SP)(SP)O(PT) is left. That means T must be in slot 4.
SPOT is right, and PSOT is not.
>>BOREDOM BEDROOM
# logic for me arts
?How do I decipher the ME ARTS?
The ME ARTS has a big long name. MREAST STREAM TAMERS.
The two question marks seem like a problem but aren't really. One must be a consonant, and one must be a vowel.
But note the first one has only consonants as guesses, and one must be right, so the second is a vowel.
The only vowel that could match up in slot 2 is A. That makes slot 5 E.
-A--E- is left, but the last consonant can't be M/S/T, so it is R. The second (slot 3) can't be M, and slot 4 can't be R. This isn't a big help, but with fewer than six possibilities left, you can guess around and get MASTER.
# logic for bortles lobster
?What about the BORTLES Lobster?
It gives ?GR??G?, which looks horrible...
...until you notice there are only two vowels, total. That gives -O---E-, and the rest are consonants.
In fact, each slot is one of two consonants.
(BL)O(LST)(TS)(LT)E(RS).
B must be in slot 1, R in slot 7. That leaves three possibilities based on what slot 3 is.
BOLSTER turns out to be the right one.
# logic for lead
?What do I do with _Lead_?
For <b>LEAD</b>, by the two authors, ???R looks painful indeed. But the red means a consonant which can't be D. So it's L. Fortunately, there are just three choices.
<pre>?A?L -> EADL\nA??L -> AEDL</pre>
So, ??AL = DEAL. You could, of course, use non-teach mode to knock this off. It'd put the consonants at the end and the vowels in the middle.
>>ECON CONE
# logic for praise
?What's with the praise and its three question marks?
It is the content of the praise that is throwing the questions.
<pre>SPAREI\nAPESIR\nPRAISE\nIREAPS\nIRESAP</pre>
Also, you may note that three consonant slots are defined, meaning the question marks are all vowels. So let's nail down the consonants first in ?RR?R?.
Slot 2 cannot be P or R, so it's S. We can't get any information for slot 3, since only vowels appear there in the praise. Slot 5 cannot be S or P, so it's R. That means 3 must be P: ?SP?R?.
Now the remaining slots must be vowels, leaving (ai)SP(ai)R(ie), since one of the vowels in each slot must be right. But then slot 6 is the only one that can be E, leavin ISPARE or ASPIRE. ASPIRE.
>>UPSCALE CAPSULE
# logic for salt
?What about the salt?
The St. Al Salt can probably be figured without clues, but let's go through it anyway.
ST AL and SALT has R?R?. This gives no yellow or green, so the A must appear in a slot with a question mark, or the second. -A--.
Slot 4 is LT, slot 1 is LT and slot 3 is ST. That leaves TASL or LAST, which means LAST.
# logic for Sister Tressi
?How do I figure out Sister Tressi?
Sister Tressi gives a couple question marks, but with all the vowels accounted for, we know the remaining slots must be consonants.
In fact, the second being a yellow/vowel and not I means it's an E, and thus the other vowel is an I.
Also, R is the only possible consonant in slot 1. RE-I--.
Here we see that slot 3 is S or 3, and slot 5 is S or E. So they're both S, and slot 6 is T.
RESIST.
# logic for blamer balmer
?How do I figure Blamer Balmer?
Blamer Balmer has just one question mark. So he's not too tough to figure out.
R?RRRY means that the second slot is a vowel, one of A and L, so A. That means slot 6 is E.
The red Mr. Beal and LeBram clues should clinch that the verb is RAMBLE.
# logic for trance nectar
?Finally, what about the Trance Nectar?
Well, the R??YRR leaves you with a couple possibities for the 2nd/3rd slot. One vowel, one consonant.
Here a minimal bit of guesswork and grinding it out works.
-RA--- would mean CRAE(NT/TN) as there's a vowel in the fourth slot, and the first can't be N/T or R. So that doesn't work.
-EC--- would mean RECA(NT/TN) or RECANT.
>STORE W
>>TOPSIDE DEPOSIT
# logic for dreads adders
?What to do with the ambiguous Dreads Adders readings?
The Dreads Adders give RY?RYR. The question mark must be a consonant, and since the choice is D or E, it's D.
That's the only clue you can get from the question mark, but everything else must give a wrong answer, so that helps.
There are only six possibilities left, but the ED SARD red clue forces the D to the 4th spot, and since S can't be in 6, it's in 1. SEDDAR or SADDER is SADDER.
>>SCOPE COPSE
# logic for bluster butlers
?How can I interpret the bluster butlers' clue?
R?RRR?? looks like garbage, but then there's only one consonant in the three question marks. If it were in slot 2, that would mean serious clogging.
So if one of L or U must be slot 2, we can assume U. Then slot 6 is E/R and 7 is R/S. But we need the E somewhere, so we get -U---E(R/S). That's as far as logic can get you. (LRST)U(BLRS)(BRT)(BLRS)E(RS) leaves a lot, though.
You can listen to the butlers, examine them or run past them to get other clues (TRUBLE'S, LES BURT, URL BEST), and since they could afford to be quieter, you may find SUBTLER anyway.
# logic for snider diners
?What about the snider diners?
The snider diners are the next to pop up questions, though you may not need to use question marks' flexibility to deal with them.
There are question marks at locations 2, 3 and 5. What does this mean? It means 2 and 3 are I or N. 5 must be E or R. Since 2-3 are I-N, that means R??R?R needs a vowel, which must be E, because I-N must be in 2 and 3.
You can switch to non-cheat mode to discover if it is I-N or N-I, or you can keep plugging away elsewhere. For instance, slot 1 can't be S or D--or N. So it is R. R(IN)(IN)(SD)E(SD).
Slot 6 can't be R or S, so it has to be D, leaving S in slot 4. R(in)(in)SED, and RNISED is out, so, RINSED.
# logic for Muscly Luc Sym
?How do Muscly Luc Sym's question marks shake out?
Muscly Luc Sym only appears if you are male, but his question mark should be pretty clear. There is no O or B, so therefore, the Y must be at the end. --U--Y, then, since there is only one vowel.
The remaining reds strike out possibilities pretty easily. (CS)(CLMS)U(LM)(CMS)Y.
But let's look for nonsense words. S in the first slot gives SMULCY/SLUMCY, so it's C. C(LMS)U(LM)(MS)Y.
If we work on slot 2, CMULSY and CSULMY aren't words, so it's CLUMSY.
>>BALDEST BLASTED SALTBED
# logic for fluster self rut
?What do the question marks mean for the fluster self rut?
R?RRR?R leaves only vowels in the question mark spots. The first is L or E, the second E or U. That makes -E---U-.
The fluster/self-rut cuts down a lot of possibilities, but now we can cut out even more with examining and so forth. TRU-SELF and FURLETS help a lot.
This, like many in store W, may have you reflect on the meaning of the final word. In this case, what is calm at the end? And with TRUSELF and FURLETS, you're left with REFTSUL and RESTFUL, e.g. RESTFUL.
# logic for docile old ice
?How does the docile old ice work?
The R?YRYR scan means letter 2 is O or L. Count the consonants and vowels, and it needs to be O.
Everything else is a wrong letter. That leaves (CL)O(IE)(CDL)(IE)(CDL), which you may be able to brute force.
Or you can examine twice, and you're reminded of LiedCo. That forces 1 to C and 3 to I, so COI(DL)E(DL). But 4 can't be D, so, COILED.
>>UNBLEST SUNBELT
# logic for dandier arid den
?How do I decipher the dandier arid den?
The dandier arid den appears to give two annoying question marks to start in cheat mode. In normal mode, the endorsers should wrap things up, but cheat mode's two question marks make things fall out even more nicely.
The ??YYRGR gives three known vowels and two consonants, so we need two consonants. A or D in slot 1 is D, and A or R in slot 2 is R. Also, slot 6 is E because of the green.
DR---E- seems much more manageable. Since slot 3 is a vowel and can't be I, it's A, and slot 4 is the other vowel, I.
DRAI-E- now has red in slot 5, so it can't be D from the arid den. It's N. DRAINED.
>>ANEMIC CINEMA
# logic for angriest ingrates
?How do I resolve the question marks for the angriest ingrates?
Well, the ?PPRRY?R gives you two consonants right off the bat. And the first question mark must be a vowel, leaving the second as a vowel, too--or E.
So (AI)NG(ST)(RST)(AI)ER--the 8th slot can't be S or T--and this leaves four guesses.
There are a lot of clues if you listen, but brute force may be more effective, here. ANGSTIER.
# logic for resident trendies
?How do I navigate the resident trendies?
The R?RRY?R? presents a problem if we look at strict logic: slot 6 is a vowel, E or I, but then there are consonant-vowel differences.
We have (NDS)(ER)(DNRT)(DRTS)(IE)(IE)(DRTS)(ST). But note if slot 2 is a vowel, we have a lot of clogging, so we can call that E.
(NDS)E(DNRT)(DRTS)(IE/EI)(DRTS)(ST). Now this is where you may need to look at a lot of the clues. This has plenty, if you listen to what they have to say.
It can cut things down for you to where you have NERDIEST.
>>TREADING GRADIENT
# logic for raves saver
?How do I tweak the Raves Saver, with its six letter clue?
It's not quite a raves saver. It's a REPLAY PLAYER according to the scanner.
This is one where having the non-cheat version shows a lot more. But we'll go strictly with cheat mode for as long as possible.
First we note that Y is in slot 6. Since there is no O anywhere, and slot 4 (Y in Player) shows red, and no other question mark contains a possible Y, the Y must be in slot 6.
If we go through the question marks, we get (PR)(EL)(PA)(PL)(RPL)Y. But then slots 2 and 3 are the only ones with E and A. That makes things easier. (PR)EA(RL)(PLR)Y.
So if we try R in slot 1, we get REALPY, which is not a word. PEA(RL)(RL)Y gives PEARLY.
# logic for sweatier wait-seer
?What can I learn about the sweatier wait-seer?
The two question marks don't tell as much as we'd hoped: ?YYRY?RR gives SW in slot 1, IE in slot 6. But then, A must be in slot 3, since I and E are out. (SW)(IE)A(SWR)(IE)(IE)(SWRT)(SWT).
From here you may just need to grind out letters that can't work (W in slots 7/8 clogs, and W in 4 gives SEAWEERT with one E replaced by an I.) Then I in slot 2 gives WIA(SR)EE(SRT)(ST) which seems like nonsense.
WEA(SR)(EI/IE)(SRT)(ST) could give Weariest...or you could just listen to what the wait-seer has to say, with red text that helps cut down the possibilities.
>>DANGER GARDEN
# logic for natives
?How do the natives work?
Here, with just one word for natives, there are two solutions.
The ?GYRYRR gives some clues right away. The first letter may or may not be N, but we can cheat and guess it must be, for one of the solutions. The second must be A.
NA(IE)(VS)(IE)(VST)(VT). But the V in the last two slots doesn't turn up anything close to a word. So...
NA(IE)(VS)(IE)(ST)T becomes NA(IE)V(IE)ST, or NAIVEST.
It's trickier to find the other solution, but talking to them gives a bunch of red text. That's a bit beyond deciphering the settler, but you get (NV)AI(NVS)E(NVS)T if you go through all the possibilities.
# logic for alarming grailman
?How do I navigate the alarming grailman?
With RYRRYR?R we can determine the remaining question mark is a vowel. Since the possible letters are N and A, it is A. That makes things -(AI)--(AI)-A-.
At this point, you may need to look for red letter clues. Liam Garn, his name, knocks out the vowels. -A--I-A-. Unfortunately, these were tricky to find, so I wasn't able to give many hints.
>>LOST LOTS
# logic for sporties' ripostes
?How do I deflect the sporties' ripostes?
First, note there are two vowels at positions 5 and 6, and one question mark in RR?RYYRR. So that question mark must be a vowel, O.
Slot 6 can't be I, so that gives us the vowels: --O-IE--.
Now, if you listen a lot, eliminating all the possibilities will lead to how to dispel the ripostes.
Or you can use brute force on the S's. Slots 2, 4 and 7 contain the two S's.
Now look at slot #4. If it is P, then -SOPIES- with (RT) doesn't work. If it is T, -SOTIES- again doesn't work. So let's try R in 7. -SOSIER- also has P/T left, which means no sensible words. This, S must be in the 7th place and R is in the 2nd. -ROSIES- is PROSIEST.
>>ACTIONLESS COASTLINES (GUARDING)
# logic for asset-hit atheists
?How do I get past the atheists?
The asset-hit atheists are tricky. RY?R?YR?: You can see the fifth entry must be a vowel, because the third and eighth are choices between consonants.
That's a decent start, but the rest is tricky. Still, it gives you this: (HST)(AE)(SH)(HST)I(AE)(HS)(ST).
If you talk to them, "Set, it has" giving redness means the final entry must be T. With the settler and some educated guesses, not much is left.
# logic for lois the hostile
?What can the settler tell me about Lois the Hostile?
Lois the Hostile also has a question mark to start. ?GRYYRR means the first letter is a consonant, so, H or L. Then O is letter 2. (HL)O(HLT)(OIE)(OE)(ST)(HLST).
The vowels fall here. (HL)O(HLT)IE(ST)(HLST) and now if T is in slot 3, we get (HOL/LOH)IETS, which is nothing. So (HL)O(HTL)IES(HTL). Similarly L in the first slot gives two nonsense words. So we get HOLIEST.
# logic for hostile-is-he lot
?What can the settler tell me about Hostile-Is-He Lot?
The Hostile-Is-He Lot has ??RYYR?. Now this looks like a mess, until you realize that there must be two consonants and one vowel in the questions. Each of slot 1, 2 and 7 could be a consonant or vowel.
So what if 1 and 2 are consonants? Then we'd have HS----E, which is a mess. So 7 is a consonant, or T.
If 1 is the vowel, we have IS----T, which becomes IS(LT)OE(HST)T, or ISLOEHT. So 2 must be the vowel. HO----T.
That becomes HO(LT)(OI)(OE)(HST)T, or HOLIEST.
# logic for dinger
?How do I ding up Reading: a Dinger?
The RR?YR?R scan means that the two question marks must be vowels. A and E, to be precise. That leaves I in the remaining vowel slot, so we're off to a good start.
The authors' names (Di Regan and Ned Riga) also cut things down a bit--in particular, they force the first and last letters, but let's go on without them.
With --AI-E-, we have (GN)(GRND)AI(RND)E(ND). N at the start clogs things, so we can go with G without much risk. Similarly, not many words start with GN or GD, so GRAI(ND)E(ND) gives GRAINED.
# logic for weirder red wire
?Can I do anything with the weirder red wire?
Yes, though you don't need to.
The reading is ?GRYR?R. But since slot 1 must be a consonant, we can count consonants and vowels to realize that slot 6 must be a vowel. E or R means E. Also, we can pick of slot 2, since it's green.
With -E---E- and a vowel in slot 4, we get -E-I-E-. Now from the settler's scan, 1 is W or R, and 3 and 5 can't be D. That means 7 is D. -E-I-ED.
There are three possibilities left, but RERIWED and WERIRED aren't words. REWIRED.
>>MISLIT LIMITS
# logic for pester'n serpent
?How do I interpret the pester'n serpent scans?
The ?RYRG?? leaves a lot of question marks, but since the only vowel is E, you can knock that off quickly. And you also know all the ?'s are consonants.
So, --E-E-- is a start, even before navigating the question marks.
Then (PS)(PSTRN)E(RSN)E(RN)(NT) is left. That's really not too bad, despite slot 2 looking like it has a lot of possibilities. If you pick off the other ones, it goes quickly.
For instance, N in the final slot gives PTESERN. That's not a word, so we can put T there. (PS)(PSRN)E(RSN)E(RN)T.
Now we can pick off slot 4 a bit if we want. S gives PSE(RN)(RN)T, not a word, N gives PNESERT, and R gives PRESENT. PRESENT.
# logic for curst palace
?What can I do with the curst palace?
There's not much with the settler's question mark. Castle Apcur/Curst Palace has a question at the end.
Counting vowels and consonants--and noting slot 5 must be a consonant though it's a question mark--tells you a consonant is at the end, so you have an R there. That's a decent start.
You'll need a few more clues from the surrounding scenery to fix stuff, if you want to do more scanning..
>>MESPRISE PREMISES
# logic for tetris sitter
?How can I decipher the Tetris Sitter?
With ?RYRRY, the first letter is a consonant, which is S or T.
But what of the others? The fourth slot is a consonant, too, but it cannot be R or T. That means it is S. But since the first letter is T or S, it must be T. T-(IE)S-(IE).
Since TT clogs things up, you get TR-ST-. TRISTE is a word, but TRESTI isn't.
>STORE Y
>>POSH HOPS SHOP
# logic for gins sign
?How do I do something with/to the gins sign?
A reading of ?G?R means that you have -I-(consonant) but you can figure the consonant.
It can't be S or N so it's G.
Now G can't be in slot 1 or 3, so it has to be the other letters--N for gins, S for sign. SING.
# logic for perma-amper
?How do I neutralize the perma-amper?
The Perma-Amper shows you R?RYR in cheat mode. So there must be a vowel at location 2: a choice between E or M.
M's not a vowel, so slot 2 is E, but that leaves A (the other vowel) for slot 4.
That leaves (rm)E(m)A(mp) if we eliminate the consonants in Perma-Amper, or REMAP. Note this isn't too hard without figuring what the ?'s are for, but if you get it anyway, you may be able to look back and see why the question mark is there.
# logic for casper
?How do I neutralize Casper Spacer or Capers Recaps?
Casper and the Capers both give clues consistent with each other, but Capers Recaps's result will help you a lot more. Together, they give a solution by force.
Casper Spacer gives ?RRYRY, meaning the first letter is a consonant, C or S. He doesn't match up well with the vowels you need. That's not very good.
# logic for capers
?How do I do use the Casper and Capers clues together?
CAPERS RECAPS gives RRR??Y. That means either E or A is in slot 4, and the C and R in slot 1 are wrong. Along with the information about Casper, this tells us the word we need starts with S. Also, one of R/P is right in slot 5.
Note that slot 3 is a consonant but not P, C or (slot 1) S. So it is R.
S(CP)R(ae)(rp)(ae) then becomes SCR(ae)P(ae). SCRAPE.
>>LAPSIN' PLAINS
# logic for span pans
?What's with the span pans' double clue?
You have ?R?R, which can nail down slot 4: a consonant that's not N or S. P.
Since P is taken, slot 1 can't be P, so it's S. S--P.
Now there must be a vowel, but it's not slot 2, so it's slot 3. S-AP. SNAP.
# logic for plains
?What else can I do in the plains?
The LAPSIN PLAINS give RRRY??. There is thus one vowel and one consonant to cover.
However, the only possible vowel is the I, which is in slot 5. This also determines slot 4. ---AI-, or ---AI(NS).
(NS)(NSP)(NSL)AI(NS) is what is left if you go through what LAPSIN and PLAINS eliminate. So then slot 2 is P, and 3 is L.
NPLAIS is not a word, but SPLAIN is, though slightly slangy. That's why it's an LLP.
>>ACHERS' ARCHES
# logic for achers' arches
?How do I navigate the achers' arches?
This seems confusing if you take the arches literally. RY?RRR needs a vowel in the third slot, but it should be H or C according to the question on the settler--except that they are also CHASER arches.
That gives you the vowel you need, and it drops the other vowel in place. (CHRS)EA(CR)(CHS)(CH) is left.
If R is in slot 1, we get REACSH. Not quite. So R is in slot 3. (CHS)EAR(CHS)(CH). If C is in slot 1, CEARSH. If H is, HEARSC. So S is. SEAR(CH/HC).
SEARCH.
>>END DEN (GLEANER)
# logic for gleaner
?What do I need to do to the general gleaner?
The gleaner gives YRR??RY to start. That means slot 4 is a or e, and slot 5 is n or r. That at least letsus know if a consonant or vowel is in each question slot.
Here we're going to cheat a bit and assume A is in slot 4, because that forces 1 and 7 to E. E(nrg)(lrg)A(nr)(nrlg)E and here you may have to rely on some red text to cut things down. Al Green helps a bit. E(nrg)(lr)A(nr)(nrlg)E. You may need to brute force here: If R is in slot 3, you get EGRANLE, so it's L. From there, poking around should give ENLARGE.
>>TENFOLD TEFLON'D LOFT DEN
# logic for papery yapper
?How do I use cheat mode on the papery yapper?
The clues for the yapper are ?RY?Y?. That puts the Y in slot 1 or 6: we can't tell. But we do know where the vowels are. And since slot five can't be E, it's A. That makes slot three A.
But now slot 4 is a question mark, so it's E or P. E is taken, so it's P.
(py)(pr)EPA(ry) is left. That's enough to use brute force.
YPEPAR or PREPAY are the only two choices. PREPAY.
>STORE T
>>BLEARY BARLEY
# logic for bleary barley
?How do I get rid of the bleary barley?
The settler gives P??YRB -- the B you may not have seen before, but it has to be brown based on the upper window. Brown = blue + orange, and orange is Y.
B----Y and letter 2 is L or A, while letter 3 is E or R. You can use non-cheat mode to figure things out, or if you guess letter 2 is A, 3 has to be R to keep the number of vowels/consonants straight, leaving BARELY. On the other hand, guessing BLE--Y leaves only A and R as vowel and consonant, which is a word you already have.
B--ELY is BRAELY (nah) or --BARELY.
# logic for cinders
?The cinders are weird. What to do with them?
They're meant to be a tricky LLP. There are two things you can do with them, hence the question marks.
You may need a bit of word-logic here, but the R?RR??R leaves two vowels. If there is not a vowel in the second position, then we have clumping. So the question mark is a vowel, but it could force an I or an E, depending on what you can do.
Here you may also notice that one of the two verbs must have E in the fifth slot, because of the question mark, putting I in the second.
-I--E-- and with Sr Indec and Nrdices as clues, you can get close. The last lousy point is trickier, but once you know DISCERN, you know that all the question marks are because DISCERN is right. DISCERN will give you a few hints, but what about the other?
This requires a bit more trial and error. However, we know that slot 5 can't be E and slot 6 can't be R, or there wouldn't be question marks. That cuts things down. Also, we can assume that slot 2 is a vowel, but it can't be I, or the question mark would be definite. So it is E. The result is probably the trickiest puzzle of the game. You may have to do some guessing. But it IS a last lousy point.
>>FRONTAGE
# logic for atmo-moat
?How do I destroy the atmo-moat?
This one may be guessable, but let's look at it anyway.
With ??YR for atmo/moat, we know A can't be in slot 3, but since slot 2 is T or O, that leaves just slot 1 for A. Then slot 2 must be a consonant, or T.
AT(vowel)(consonant) means ATOM.
# logic for tearily-irately
?What is up with the macks discussing reality?
There are two solutions here. From the general theme, you can probably guess things end in LY. But from there, it's less clear. In fact, even the non-cheat settings gives question marks.
The ??GR?RO for reality suggests --A--LY, and the non-cheat suggests we don't know what the first two letters are. However, the cheat vs. non-cheat suggests that E or I in the fifth slot can be an answer, and general logic says R or T must be in the fourth slot. That gets us pretty close.
(IT/TI)ARELY, (IR/RI)ATELY, (ET/TE)ARILY, (ER/RE)ATILY.
From these eight we see TEARILY or IRATELY could both work.
# logic for formally
The settler indicates two question mark entries should be consonants.
<pre>AFOLLYMR\nFLYMORAL\n?YR?YRRO</pre>\nIndicates the first letter shouly be F, and the second yellow with O in slot 5 tells us where the vowels should be.
FO--A--Y is remaining. That's twelve possibilities--well, a bit less if we assume it ends in LY. One of L and M is in slot 4, and if we assume L, we get FO(RM)LA(RM)LY, and neither of those work. But the other way we get FO(RL)MA(RL)LY, or FORMALLY.
# logic for steamily
<pre>MAYISLET\nMISTYALE\nSLIMYTEA</pre>
The question marks at 1 and 7 can be intuited a bit. M(consonant) clumps. And slot 7 must be a vowel for the letters to add up right. So... S(MT)(AE)(AE)(MT)(EI)LY is left over. That puts I in slot 6, and with 4 guesses, you can use trial and error.
SMEATILY sounds like it could be a word, and SMAETILY and STAEMILY look weird, but STEAMILY works great.
>STORE H
>>CURTIS'S COIN(S)
# logic for coins
?Why are the coins giving me such confusing clues?
The (plain) coins near the end are, unavoidably, confusing. That's because they can, like the USB, get a description and become a thing which has no letters in common.
In fact, the coins need to become two very different things. Hence all the question marks.
In this case, you may want to have scanned the coin beforehand, or take up the game's offer to scan a coin. Cheat mode should make it obvious what it should be: YRYP means (io)C(io)N or icon since i can't be in slot 3.
However, if you combine cheat and non-cheat mode, then you notice the fifth slot is the only fixed one. It is a consonant. That gives you the idea that the last letter must be S in one case and C in another, and what's more, the words share no other consonant/vowel space in common.
# logic for sonic coins
?OK, I changed the coins, and the settler's still weird on cheat mode. Now what?
The sonic coins need to be converted to something else. YRY?? leaves two consonants.
So one of I or N is the right consonant in slot 4: N. One of C or S is the right consonant in slot 5.
And also, the vowel in slot 3 can't be I, so it is O. That leaves I as the vowel in slot 1.
I(CS)ON(CS) remains, where ICONS wins over ISONC.
>>CLANGIER CLEARING
# logic for melon
?Why does something like the melon give question marks?
The melon seems like it should not be that hard, but it pops up question marks even on non-cheat mode. What is going on is that, well, you need to talk to Len, and there are two ways to do it.
The RYR??/????? suggests that a M, E and L work in some cases but not in others. You can say LEN, MO or MO, LEN to get the melon.
While this is tricky, there are a lot of other ways to get points, so I hope it's not too disappointing that the settler conks out, especially since it is five letters--and one solution simply switches two. And actually asking Len, or noticing he is part of "Melon," makes it a bit easier to ask for what you need.
>>SCAPE SPACE
# logic for inapt paint
?What should the inapt paint become?
With more than five letters, it's what it says.
The inapt paint says DESERVER RESERVED. It has a lot of question marks, but all three vowels are green in cheat mode, and one consonant even works out, giving you
-E-ER-E-
(dr)E(sv)ER(sv)E(dr) is rather easy to sift through, since there are only four possibilities. REVERSED.
