--routes revamp
--see about ORANGE
--test ways to take the pedanto-notepad
--X GUARDIAN (all of them)
--X STORE A etc
--bypass a region and try to win and look at descriptions
--examine OTTERS twice. Anything weird happen?
--SS in the anteroom and north, and other places with privately-named reflexive/vanishing scenery
