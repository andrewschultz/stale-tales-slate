Hello there! Welcome to the sequel to Shuffling Around! I hope you're just reading this due to a lack of time, or curiosity about a point you may have missed, and not due to frustration.

Whether you just want to make sure you missed a silly gag, or you're stuck on a specific section, welcome I hope this walkthrough helps without spoiling too much! I wanted to try to weave the story in without making it too big, so you didn't feel like you were just typing commands, or maybe you could see one last hint before revealing the answer.

If you're wondering about how to figure things out, especially when the settler pops up question marks, logic.htm will do a better job. (TLDR: question marks usually help you, if you think about them right!)

I've semi-hidden some Last Lousy Points to give you one more chance, but they are at the very end. You can cut and paste text to ROT13.com for those.

If you're a bit more worried about spoilers, you may want the HTML version, which has expandable InvisiClues. These should both have similar content, and they should be in the bundle with this file and the game file.

If you're the technical type, you can use the command

type roil-thru.txt | grep -iE "^>" | sed "s/^>//g"

To delete my comments and have a list of commands you can cut and paste. You can also replace ^[^>].* with nothing and \r\n\r\n with \r\n if you have a text editor that accepts regular expression replacement. This will zap everything without a > to start, then lump the lines together.

The above method will ignore alternate solutions and last lousy points, which are sort of clued in the walkthrough.

Also, using periods between commands is possible, but only for directions. The "special" commands for this game cause the Inform parser a lot of problems. My programming found no way to correct this, and it was fixed in a later version of Inform, too late for me to port my project over.

Any comments on this game, or transcripts, can go to blurglecruncheon@gmail.com. While I've tested to tackle the big stuff, bugs slip through--and hopefully they are not too much. But any help from a transcript is appreciated, for matters subjective or objective. My pre- and post- comp testers found a lot of stuff, but that sometimes just reveals other hidden problems.

Conversely you can also report issues at https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/ and they don't have to be in any professional format or anything. I'd appreciate typos/stylistic stuff being lumped together, but other than that, individual bugs--or feature requests--that aren't obviously similar can be chopped up.

This walkthrough is for version 4 of the game, which I recommend, as the puzzles and cluing make much more sense, and the hints are more detailed. Major differences in the walkthrough are labeled at the end. Version 4's main changes are different room names, and NPCs may be named differently. Some are female if you are. But the abstract puzzles have mostly not changed, except where I thought I found one clearly more sensible.

For those who played the comp version and want to see the new area(s) at the end, you can skip to that area to see the command to start the game with before you chat with Gunter. The implication being, the knocker's come back to snivel his way into your good graces.

You can also access the new area(s) that appeared in releases 2 and 3 by playing through the game proper, but I think a shortcut is fair, since the game is rather long. And, in the case of the comp release, more abstruse and occasionally unfair.

  Thanks,
  Andrew Schultz

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recommend that you search for the section you want to visit--this document is divided that way. The stores are organized in alphabetical order. I put in whitespace so one store doesn't spoil the next. Currently, you can search for

ORDEAL RELOAD
STORE P
STORE T
STORE U
STORE V
STORE W
STORE Y
STORE H

Also, I don't cover Last Lousy Points (LLPs) in any section. These are hintable in-game but I also ROT13'd them at the end. Also, for release 3, I wrote up some metrics of how big areas are. They should be included in metrics.htm.

The ORDEAL RELOAD has three separate minimal ways through. I'll list them all.

You need to do semi-constructive things so that Gunter bugs you and you have a chance to see the game's mechanics. There are a lot of things you can do, like try to figure something or look at your notepad. Seven, to be precise.

> X BOOKS
> X CHAIR
> GET NOTEPAD
> X ADS

May be the most natural way, though a quicker way is

> LAMP
> X ADS

> OPEN DOOR
> 1
(None of the other options are important, but they add color and clues, if you want them.)

> 5

You fall asleep and then wake up. How do you get a light source?

> LAMP

Oh! You found something.

> X LATCHES

And there's something in the latches! The teariest treatise from Old Man Almond is a hint. More precisely, the letters in the letter. Which contains a recoded decoder -- or a revised deviser. There's a pattern here to the anagrams, with only the first and last letters switched, so the latches become a...

> SATCHEL

(This can be done later. But if you put it off, you can't exit the manor until you figure it out.)

The giant pin is a last lousy point. It is probably harder than the three ways out, which it clues. I'll save it and other LLPs for the end.

Now to get out of your study. There are three ways. First, the tables.

> STABLE
> IN

The sitar is as useless as a hole in the ground.

> STAIR
> D

Now, you can go OUT to go back and pick up all the points if you want. You can skip down to "how to get out?" if you don't want maximum points. "My niche" looks suspicious.

> CHIMNEY
> UP

The pram has plenty of clues, like Mr. Pa in red.

> RAMP
> D

Now you can go back out again one last time to get full points.

The third way is to examine the beams. Ten of them!

> BASEMENT
> D

You can't go IN right now, as the game tells you to look at the settler. So,

> X SETTLER

Mess around with what you want. There's a tutorial anyway.

You can also do something with the ISBN bins. That's a last lousy point.

> IN

Oh no. You're under the gun. Err, the rifle.

> FLIER

You get to talk to Mole Elmo, now. He gives hints. The commands below are the quickest. If you listen to him complain, it's for your amusement only.

> 3
> Y

Or, to get basic hints,
(ALT) >2
(ALT) >2
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1

Elmo's information about the stores is purley background stuff. You may find it worthwhile.

(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1

Now, Elmo's complaints may be funny, or they may not. Let's skip them for now.

(ALT) >2

So now you're in the carven cavern. There are plates on a plaster psalter. The plates are squarish, with metal half way around ... sort of like a...

> STAPLE

What goes with a staple? Well, you can remake the psalter.

> STAPLER

The act-ruin curtain looks like lined paper, so you can just...

> PUT STAPLE IN STAPLER
> STAPLE CURTAIN

> IN

The Strip of Profits is the central hub of the rest of the game. There are a lot of stores, but the game should note which are the most interesting for your purposes. You need to complete two of them to be able to open up Store T. You can use the item that falls out after two wins to "ZAP" the other stores--or the portals you created from them--in order to skip them. But one way or another, the Trips Strip must be clear of portal stores before you enter Store T.




















































The basic flow of the game, then, is as follows.

manor -> others -> 2 of (p u v w y) if you use the patcher -> t. K/N is an optional puzzle we'll go through now. It's optional because of the slang involved and because it's a silly, minor joke.

Also, if you are curious about the main "theme" of each store, I have it in ROT13 below.

The optional stores are organized alphabetically, so you may wish to search for store (letter). The exception: H is a post-victory store, so I put it at the end.

You will get a warning before solving an area if you can still gain a few points. But if something is unachievable, then the game will not warn you. This may happen in store V, where there are a few with points you may miss. POSS will trigger when you miss them.

U = cercbfvgvbaf
V = cnffvir ireof
Y = npgvir ireof
P = vagrewrpgvbaf
W = nqwrpgvirf
T = nqireof




















































Stores K and N form a silly puzzle which is not necessary, so you may want to skip it.

Store K can be entered. Store N holds someone. They are related.

NESTOR is the guy in store N.

> NESTOR

TOKERS are the people in store K.

> TOKERS

> ENTER STEAMING

Now, a clue is how the tokers spoke. What did they use while speaking? Adjectives. You can look around at Studio E and the 'I Used To' pamphlet to figure you need to go...

> OUTSIDE

And you get something for later. The munchies let you use the slider more often. Testers didn't use the slider much, but it's nice for seeing red on all-bad guesses. You can even purposely guess wrong to see if any letters are right.












































STORE V holds troves. Troves of riches! The sort you have to think and earn! It has the fewest mandatory puzzles to win, though it and STORE U both have the same number of maximum puzzles.

> TROVES
> ENTER TROVES

Oh, look, you get a self-help book about thinking right! And how, if you think right, doing the right thing will come naturally. You're paralyzed by the hustle and bustle of the city and all that modernist stuff.

At any time, you can get a point from Peg A. Page's book.

Since the game mentions you can't do anything actively, and you need warmth and heat, you can...

> HATE

Oh no! Hate blinded you to your wallet getting stolen! But you can't race because you don't feel up to it, yet.

> CARE

There's the stop post, but you can't inspect it with the sob ever verbose distracting you.

> OBSERVE
> SPOT

This helps you move on a bit to the Boarded Roadbed, but oh no! An evil bee, so near! You only need to turn it into a vile bee. Do both and it's a live bee. So either of the two below will work. They are polar opposites but both equally valuable to positive thinking, you see. Using both gets you an extra point, so why not?

> REASON
or
> BELIEVE

Doing both gets you an extra point.

Now the cellar caller the bee was on is broken. It would get help you find the cellar pretty easily. So you need to think things out yourself.

> RECALL

So now you're in the Drain Nadir.

You've hit rock bottom, and you need to bring yourself up. If you want, you can take a flap at Sister Tressi, but you don't need to.

> DESPAIR

You've hit rock bottom. Time to pull yourself up a bit...the tune from Eddie C will help. The lyrics combining with the notes.

> DECIDE

Boredom Bedroom! You may be able to figure what to do with the lager, but it's a Last Lousy Point.

You need to do one of the two below to have confidence you can move beyond the Boredom Bedroom. There's the lobster and the ME ARTS.

> MASTER
or
> BOLSTER
(or both, for a bonus point!)

Now, you are THAT close to believing you can lead, but not quite. That book by Dale Elda and Leda Adle may help.

> DEAL

From the Browse Bowers, you need somewhere to reside.

> DESIRE

In the Econ-Cone, you need to enter the godlings' lodgings. But it's for people who are the very best, because they wanted to be. Either side of the status, there's something. The rivets saying TREVIS VISTER and the Praise Spirea.

> ASPIRE
or
> STRIVE
(or both, for a bonus point!)

Hm, that Pernod dropped in the fray is tempting. But you can't enter the lodgings with your current sales pitch.

> PONDER

Wow! An office. But it's not properly stocked for being Numero Uno. Just the red vees.

> DESERVE

DIVORCES magazine is a bonus point.

What to do now? To be worth your salt?

> LAST

Now to be productive, with either the Marble Blamer or Sister Tressi watching you.

> RAMBLE
or
> RESIST
(or both, for a bonus point!)

You're tired. There's that Trance Nectar which can help you be more productive. It's totally different from the Large Regal Lager! But you still don't want to drink it. Maybe break free...

> RECANT















































STORE U is the one with the fewest puzzles to win.

> ROUTES
> IN

What is going on here? You can't go in any direction. They don't make sense. And you can't even easily enter the places listed. Perhaps the church sign provides a clue. You shouldn't need the letters settler, though you can flip the letters on the church sign for an additional clue in cheat mode.

The Worst Ad is a Last Lousy Point. It's not necessary, so I won't spoil it here. You probably will guess it, since there are only so many words it can be, based on the words you use here.

The church sign says DIE SIN or SIN DIE. And going IN doesn't work.

> INSIDE

> X LIST

Hmm, a list of stuff on the wall. Maybe the stuff is in the other locations.

> EXIT

If you examine the bench, it's a giant's.

> AGAINST

Climb up on the bench armrest and hear his tirades.

> ASTRIDE

Duck his elbow.

> BELOW

Rude 'N Nuder?

> UNDER

How to get into Pat's?

> PAST

And what to do about the seed pit?

> DESPITE

Yay, mushrooms.

> EXIT

Oscar's?

> ACROSS

How to get the pipe soot?

> OPPOSITE

> EXIT

> IN (INSIDE is not necessary now that you've gained the priest's trust)
> EXIT

Oh no! A MORF-FORM! Maybe you can't change it, but you can change WHERE it is.

> FROM

How do you get the crowd to help you where to go next, around the bean?

> BENEATH

The Harms Marsh is unlit.

> UNTIL

So you need to find an un-road.

> AROUND

And No-Gal Logan.

> ALONG

Da Mist is certainly intimidating!

> AMIDST

Now, on the boat, Logan's masterpiece gives you a clue.

> ATHWART

The sonancy canyon has a lot of noises. First, deal with the bent ewe. Make her feel safer from the hurt hog.

> BETWEEN

Now help the hurt hog.

> THROUGH

There's a chance for the LLP with the patters. Not changing them but their content. Or you can just deal with the yob den.

> BEYOND

That will do it! Since you've solved two store regions, you can now zap stores with the patcher or switch the patcher to reach Otters, if you wish to skip to the end of the game.













































STORE Y seems to be something underwater-ish. It's overall probably a bit easier than Store P, though there are more points to gain. Shorter words.

> OYSTER
> IN

Okay, you're in an action-packed bar. It's totally action-filled, and you need to take evasive action. But first, how to get in there?

You can do something with the sign, which hints what sort of words can be used here. It's a last lousy point. The pills can also help you skip a puzzle if you SPILL them.

Still, it looks like you need to get rid of the trolls to start. They're there to keep people in, suggesting they do belong there, or haven't done enough. You need to perform three of six actions to annoy people at the Posh Hops Shop.

> SING
> SPIT
> INSET

(Note: these are the other possibilities. Don't go in for 4, or the trolls will get you. Well, unless you want to see the randomized death messages.)
(ALT) > UNSET/REMAP (each of these destroys the tunes/perma-amper, so they are mutually exclusive)
(ALT) > SCRAPE

Note that you don't need to provide an object with these verbs, or any of the verbs you need to win this area. Yes, this section means active verbs. It's a(nother) guess-the-verb section!

And the next verb to guess is, how to get away from the trolls, coolly?

> STROLL

Stupid clam. Won't settle down.

> CALM

You're stuck in the olde lode, and you can't walk away from the urn! Not in any direction!

> RUN

Well now, how do you arrive past a river? There are boats, and there is a raft. The canoe is a red herring, and it can change to something that won't help you at all. In fact, it gives an InstaDeath.

> BOAST

And you'll be picked up. You then need to get out...

> LEAP

(However, you can also enter the raft, propel it and use the oars, for an extra point)

(ALT) > ENTER RAFT
(ALT) > FART
(ALT) > SOAR

Lots of violence in Anger Range. First things first. Protect that trout! Two ways. Either opens up the east.

> SCRAP (with the CARPS) or
(ALT) > SPIKE (the pikes)

> E

The eeks are loud. Someone's upset the trout is hurt! (And yes, the cans are a last lousy point. I bet you can guess, though if you leave without changing them, you can't come back.)

> SEEK

Teach the trout to not get beaten up later.

> TUTOR

Now Aunt Tuna is happy. Reward in the drawer! You can also fix the dent for a last lousy point. Again, it's not a hard one, I hope. I think.

You can get the wipes if you want. They lead to a side quest I will detail at the end.

But you want to be a good guest. The food isn't bad.

> EAT TEA

You will find the other half of the paler pearl later.

> W

> N

At any time here in the plains you can just sound off for a LLP based on the location name. There are a few silly guesses, too.

The skis are blocking the span pans. The knob is jammed.

> KISS SKIS
> BONK KNOB

Oh no! You keep getting hit by a crate.

> TRACE
> REACT

Ah, that'll do it.

> KISS SKIS
> BONK KNOB

Okay, now to deal with the span pans.

> SNAP

> IN

The tubs are probably hiding something.

> BUST

The prod needs something simple to jar and open it. It's a command that's generally pointless in the game, except now.

>DROP

You can do part of the side quest here to find a shiny weapon. Or just go out. Let's go west of the plains.

> OUT

> S

> W

That sardine is nosey but sensitive to noise.

> WARP

Did you examine the arches? How about examining more thoroughly?

> SEARCH ARCHES

The two paler pearls fit to become a general gleaner...which is too small to read. Fortunately, that's only temporary!

> ENLARGE
> X GLEANER

> N

The weaselly walleyes are watching you and not watching you. Maybe you can frame them.

> W

Ah, the Rascal Craals. Imagine if someone or something found the ruby here. They'd know who to suspect, amirite?

> BURY

With the ruby buried, you can summon the ghost in Anger Range, now.

> E
> S
> E

Okay, you need to dig up the spirit...

> UNEARTH

What's this? It's a sausage? Well, there's only one way to calm it down.

> ASSUAGE

> W
> N
> W

...this shows it where the ruby was! You framed the weaselly walleyes. The ghost scares them away.

You shouldn't need to go...

> E

The Ol' Trap needs to be disarmed, somehow, but you're not sure where the disarming device is.

> PATROL

You find a portal behind it!

> IN

You can probably figure what to do with the ant, if you're doing the side quest.

The lever can be used. Or, rather, not used. For a bonus point. But here is what you really want to do, in the Loft/Den.

The papery yapper is adamant you can't bribe it--as such...

> PREPAY

Oh dear! You need to do something with the dialer.

> DERAIL

That's a warning from Elvira! And now the pins are in the way!

> SPIN PINS

Or SNIP them, even if you aren't carrying a sharp object.

> REDIAL

This solves the oyster but doesn't get you through the side quest, which is detailed in the appendix.




















































STORE P can be transformed and entered, too.

> PRESTO

You can eat the curst crust for a clue in the next zone. The crust will make you Say Stuff.

> ENTER SPOT

That lamb is too scared to move. Or not scared enough. It is a last lousy point but not a hard one. The maze has two solutions: a cheap short one and a cheap long one.

Can't get over the hump to the west?

> UMPH

There is the hoop--or ye hoop--but if you jump for it, you can't bring yourself to drop your possessions.

> POOH

Or, for an extra point,

(ALT) > PHOOEY

> E
> S

How to get the star?

> RATS

What to do for the dart?

> DRAT

> S

Oh no! Leo is too big to beat physically. Rope-a-dope time.

> OLE

Hmm, a guy named Rand, a lot like Leo.

> DARN

That wasn't too bad! But they might be good in another fight. Be nice to them, now. They aren't really washups. Talk to them if you want, then...

> WHASSUP
> N
> N

The volt maze is not worth going through manually. You can solve it just reading the zany meter and seeing the maze's name. Or, just notice the name of the rooms and say to yourself, I really don't want to go through!

> WONT

But if you want full points and want to look through the maze, you meet a guy named Lev Matzo, then Matzo Lev, then Tom Alvez. The maze also goes from L to V. It also has a brand name, and touching the walls makes you see red. The scanner may be necessary, too, though altogether you have enough clues for...

(ALT) > MAZELTOV

Space or no space! You can't deal with what replaced the maze yet (note if you go north you get in a fight,) but let's worry about that later.

If you try going north, you still get smoked. Even if you know what to do with the ether. Your leadership skills--and some items--may help later. Get rid of the plebe.

> BLEEP
> E

Now you can do something with the Sport Ports for a last lousy point. It's an obscure word, and in fact it's an interjection I didn't know until I started really poking around, but it turned up and felt appropriate.

Gun doesn't go boing?

> BINGO
> PUT DART IN POPGUN
> W
> N

Hmm, fight to the north through ether.

> THERE

> N

Oh no! Saps' Pass looks tricky. The hogs! And the keys! Fake them out with...

> SYKE
or
(ALT) > GOSH

Neither is better than the other.

Now Saps' Pass is the Phat Path. But now you need to ditch Rand and Leo, who want to visit the shack. Three ways--choose two.

> LATER
> SO LONG
or
(ALT) > TOUGH

Oh, you can deal with that hawt thaw if you want, too, but it's a last lousy point. It was an extremely badly clued puzzle in version 1, so it's a sort of inside joke with myself, but I doubt it's too opaque. You probably know what to do.

> N

Read the schematic catechism a few times if you want--I sort of generated a lot of doctor names from a script. And some of the longer anagrams were fun. Originally, it was part of the puzzle to fix up the computer, but things didn't quite work right. So now it's just a silly prop to hold more anagrams.

The trim socks are a last lousy point. This one is not meant to be easy, but if you know about computer hardware, maybe it is.

The Clack Ops Locs Pack is useless in its present form.

> CAPS LOCK

Everlasting gum?

> MUG

Giant flea?

> LEAF

Disk with a reversible compression algorithm? Portability?

> SKID
> PUSH SKID S
> G
> G

The drab yoke looks like...a keyboard. But how to get the yak to move?

> PUT LEAF ON SKID
> PUSH SKID N
> G
> G

Okay. So the YrNet Entry detached the drab yoke from the yak. Now you need fuel for thought.

> COLA

And a place to rest.

> FUTON

> KEYBOARD

Okay, put it all together.

> DISK
> PUT DISK IN DRIVE
> PUT KEYBOARD ON TABLE
> PUT CAPS LOCK IN KEYBOARD

The TBA key is optional. But obviously, it will save time if you change it to what it should be. This is easier than the ROM sticks.

Now for a monitor.

> SCREEN
> PUT SCREEN ON TABLE

What are the buttons for? To be or...(not to be/too bent)

> PUSH REBOOT

Slipping on peels? Probably use the futon.

> SLEEP

Read the polemic again.

> COMPILE

Oh no! It works, but it doesn't work right. It won't...BUDGE.

> DEBUG

Okay, how to get out of here? The UBS must be really universal. Because it can also be...

> SUB (or...)
(ALT) > BUS

(As with the hogs, neither option is better than the other. Though you can undo and try the other for slightly different text.)

















































STORE W has the most puzzles, with some of the longest words, but a ton of them are optional. Also, you can figure what to do with the Curst Palace Castle Apcur right away, but you still have to get there.

The GT command may be particularly useful here to save dealing with trivia.

> TOWERS
> ENTER TOWERS

Now, a clue is what the towers inspired. Adjectives. You've got a bunch of guys to deal with here in the Trefoil. Seven, to be exact, though you only need to get rid of four, including Rodney. Rodney's babble should give you a clue as to what to do.

Since Rodney is the leader, you can't get rid of him until two or fewer others are left. You get no penalty for leaving someone, and you get no reward for clearing everything beyond just points. The enemies appear at random, and they are chosen from pods of five or so to ensure that they're not randomly too long or too short overall. I've listed them in alphabetical order, by warrior.

or (iffy word here, but why not?)

(ALT) > DRONEY

Okay. The dreads adders. They sure seem confident! Make them feel a bit less aggressive.

> SADDER

Also, if you want, you can

(XTR) > GET START TARTS
(XTR) > GET TOASTER

The toaster allows you to eat stuff which can XRAY stuff you need to look at. Though with this walkthrough, you won't need it.

The next part doesn't need to be ALL done. You can deep-six all but, uh, five of the guardians. (Leave an H shape. Or an I--H rotated by 90 degrees. And you need to clear both guardians in the Actionless Coastline.)

> N

If you want to see a map in the Scope Copse,

> X SCOPE

It updates as you knock off guardians. You can check this after your first challenges.

The yurts are an LLP. I'll let you guess.

Those bluster butlers are guarding something important, but maybe you can make them better butlers. You can't do anything west, yet, but let's get them out of the way.

> SUBTLER

You won't win a fight with someone muscly.

> CLUMSY

The snider diners are sure you can't get past them. The dry wit!

> RINSED

North or east doesn't really matter, but let's go east first. It's slightly shorter.

> E

The man who is not Flemish just wants to be...

> HIMSELF

The dandier arid den won't let you pass without purchasing some of that Nerd-Aid! But you don't have any money.

> DRAINED

> N

The weeds are free to move until they're...

> SEWED

You can do something with the denim, too.

The pirates are ruddier than you? Maybe you need to make it so they need a tan.

> PASTIER

The alarming grailman is good at his job.

> MARGINAL

The Reed's Ale vendor (differs if you're male or female) can't decide if he should stay or go. To break Lars/Else free from obligations,

> RELEASED

(ALT) > RESEALED (to get Lars's/Elsa's costume to fit)

> E

Now whether you are facing Lois the Hostile or the Hostile-is-He Lot, they really need to become much, much nicer.

> HOLIEST

The ego-drains are organised. You are crushed with feelings of inadequacy, until they're overblown.

> GRANDIOSE

> S

The natives' site van won't budge, but maybe you can convince them to move...

> VAINEST
(ALT) > NAIVEST

There's no real difference. Also, there's nothing really to the south except a hint-pastry, which you won't need with this walkthrough. But you can get an LLP point in the Lost Lots to the south, taking the strudel the right way.

The bonker is working fine until it's...

> BROKEN

Oh no! But a stinger takes its place! And it's active! There must be something important behind!

> RESTING

> E

Dr. Yow is imprisoned and can't talk until you make the good Doctor ...

> WORDY

You'll need Dr. Yow's voice for later.

> PUSH RETAPE

Dr. Yow can also be something else, but you don't need that, yet.

> W

> N

> N

The atheists can talk nice and slow and patiently, until you disrupt them a bit.

The Coasting Agnostic will help you later.

> W

The Sweatier Wait-Seer does not get tired until you force it...

> WEARIEST

> W

Now there are three guardians.

Let's take care of the resident trendies to make passage easier.

> NERDIEST

The ingrates were angriest, but now they're...

> ANGSTIER

Now you can detour for an LLP. There are two ways to take the Strudel in Lost Lots.

The admirer is unattached until...

> MARRIED

or, if you're mean,

(ALT) > MARDIER

(As with the natives' site van, choosing one over the other has no effect on gameplay.)

By the way, the keycar appears in the first place that is free of guardians. It's possible to clear the area without seeing the keycar, but not very. The keycar is an LLP. To avoid it altogether, you could avoid changing Muscly, the wait-seer, the reed's ale and the drained arid den. This is probably harder to work out than just disposing of a few more guardians, but in case you were wondering, it is possible.

> N

> PUSH REPEAT

The duck hears Dr. Yow's voice, and that establishes trust.

(Note: you can GO TO somewhere if you want to shave off a few turns. In this case, GO TO SUBSECTOR or GO TO YOW or even GT YOW. So let's do that now. It's easier than S.S.S.E.E.E etc. You save a few keystrokes and maybe a second or two.)

> GT YOW

The fissure can be messed with, and so can the (locked) gate.

> UNLOCKED works, because the lone duck is an anagram, and you know it's Dr. Yow's.

> FUSSIER makes the duck curious enough to poke at the fissure and unlock it, too.

(Note that, strictly, GT COPSE actually takes more keystrokes here. But you may find it more convenient.)

> W

The Coasting Agnostic is engrossed in a faux-intellectual book. Let's give 'em something better to do by making the book less palatable.

> TELL AGNOSTIC ABOUT YOW

(There are other ways to do this, but this is the most straightforward...I think.)

The Coasting Agnostic's still having a little trouble concentrating, but nothing big. Tentative. LLP time!

Now for something to listen to that's interesting.

> ROWDY

Science! It's so exciting!

> W
> N
> N

Incidentally, you can do something with the raves saver, since it calls itself a replay player. It's a purely aesthetic LLP.

> GIVE GIZMO TO AGNOSTIC

Now there are two ways to do things. You can repair the boat all the way, or you fix it one way and get stuck in the water. Each way gives the same amount of points.

> STABLER
> ROBUST

If you only do one, you go to Rawest Waters, where the eastern shore looks almost reachable.

> NEAREST

Now, in the mislit limits, you can straight-out win the game. But what if you want to help Renato's quest? There's that unripe ur-pine.

> PUNIER

The crocus goes in the flowerpot. But now the Pester'n Serpent won't let go until you make it just...

> PRESENT

> W

The Tetris Sitter is waiting for you. But she is very disconnected.

Give her the flowerpot, and she will give you hints if you go in and out.

Now, to win the whole deal.

========================================================


















































STORE T is the final store.

> OTTERS
> ENTER OTTERS

You can manage only the weakest type of words. What is the weakest part of speech? The adverb!

You need to get rid of that barley.

> BARELY

The former yielder speaks boomingly.

> REEDILY

The cinders are a bonus point. DISCERN will help you get a free pass anywhere, or...well, the other is a Last Lousy Point.

> W

How to help Gretta ward off the macks? There are seven things they say, divided into pods. You have 7-word and 8-word adverbs with and without repeating letters, 9-word adverbs, 10-word adverbs and a 12-word adverb. Since these are random for each playthrough, randomly picking one word in each pod won't work. If you're curious, the strategy requiring the fewest keys to type in involves guessing the 12- and 11-letter words, then either the duplicate or unique seven-letter words.

You only need three of the seven words.

This twelve-letter adverb always works:
> DESPAIRINGLY

One of these two ten/eleven-letter adverbs will work:
> DESPERATELY
> EMOTIONALLY
> DRAWLINGLY

Here are the nine-word adverbs:
> MARTIALLY
> SINCERELY
> SOBBINGLY
> TEDIOUSLY
> WEARINGLY

Here are the unique-letter eight-word adverbs (also called isograms. Knowledge!) :
> MODESTLY
> STEAMILY
> STUPIDLY

Here are the duplicate-letter eight-word adverbs:

> BLEARILY
> COITALLY
> FORMALLY
> RIBALDLY
> SHABBILY
> SHODDILY
> SILENTLY
> SUDDENLY

Here are the unique-letter seven-word adverbs (also called isograms. Knowledge!) :
> SAINTLY
> SHADILY
> SNIDELY
> STARKLY

Here are the duplicate-letter seven-word adverbs:
> BOSSILY
> SEEDILY
> TACITLY
> TEARILY/IRATELY (you can use either one--note no letters are duplicated, but there are two solutions, so it got bumped to the "easy" pool)

Now we're going to skip the conversation, here, but you may wish to work through it. Gretta describes what sort of allies work best against Elvira and why.

Nails, thrones, pines, corona. You actually only need three of these, but I hope they are not too hard.

> SNAIL

> RACOON

(Two c's works, too.)

You don't need to change the fourth non-animal, but why not.

(XTR) > HORNETS

You may notice the other of your medals changing as you summon these animals.

You have enough allies now. Time to kill the hardy hydra.

> N

> W

> W

> W

You can get an LLP shutting Elmer and Merle up before getting rid of them, if you want.

But hmm, what could beat a hydra? Something you already saw! Something like...what the parrot was!

> RAPTOR

Hmm, the whistle is interesting. Sounds like it yelped.

> DEEPLY

You may need to use those medals before visiting Elvira. Hm, IQ + Lucky = ...

> QUICKLY

> W

The repartee is just there for your amusement. But Elvira won't kill you ASAP, since you disabled her weapons. Unless you wait helplessly, and she regains confidence. You just need to make sure you have enough backup. If you didn't fix the whistle, you can retreat and do so.

> 7

> PLAY WHISTLE

And you have rescued Yorpwald from Elvira! I hope you enjoyed this. Maybe even...enough to play the epilogue.













































STORE H

This is a sort of catch-all area that I hope is still entertaining. Some of the puzzles are a bit obscure, but they're intended to be, since you only need to "get" 20 basic ones, and you can probably guess the category. I left out the tougher ones for expedience.

You can actually win Store H/Others without visiting the Clangier Clearing, if you plan right, but I figure I'd give the whole panoramic view.

If you've already completed the game, you can

> ROVE OVER

> OTHERS

> X STAND
> PEARS
> PLUMS
> GRAPES
> BLUEBERRIES

Hmm! What to do with a moss cap?

> COMPASS

> N

Some goofy puzzles here. You probably figured the general theme.

> APPLES
> APRICOT
> GOOSEBERRY
> COCONUTS

> S

Yay, a tekno-token for money.

> LIMES
> POMEGRANATE
> CANTALOUPE
> PERSIMMON

And now a coin!

> N

> E

You can do a lot of things here in the Clangier Clearing.

> SOLEMN
> MO LEN
> CRIPES
> ANCIENTER

> W

You could return for another coin, but let's get all Curtis has to offer and also explore the rest of this area.

> W

> PINEAPPLE
> STRAWBERRIES
> BLACKBERRIES
> RASPBERRY

There's a lot more to do here and elsewhere, and you can probably guess a lot of the other fruits, but you have the minimum you need, now.

> E
> S

 Ooh, stuff from Curtis. Let's deal with the coins, because you don't need money with your tekno-token and droll dollar. They're almost artsy. Musical. Like some sort of drawing.

> SONIC
> ICONS

(Note: this should be doable in any order, e.g. coin->icon first and so forth.)

> N
> D
> GIVE DOLLAR TO TRADER

That gives you the "useless" so-great storage.

> PUT ICONS IN SLOT

Woohoo! A popstar's passport! Maybe it can get you through the gate!

> U
> N
> N

 Hmm, the passport is not enough on its own. Maybe you need to use it, or parts of it. Like the viewer and the searcher. They are not hard to use! Probably a lot easier to tinker with than other things in this game.

> REVIEW
> RESEARCH

(You can also note you get called a perp if you go north. That gives a third verb you should have no problem guessing. But you only need two, and, in fact, that's what the game will let you have. Note none of these are meant to be too hard, since you're really just putting ER at the end to RE at the start.)

(ALT) > N
(ALT) > PERP

 Hooray! The final FINAL ending!

OR IS IT? Well, there is still Demo Dome Mode, which isn't an adventure but more a museum-style thing to examine stuff. You won't need a walkthrough for that.











































There is not much to do in the DEMO DOME MODE other than to examine everything. The game keeps track of how much you have left to examine in any one room and nags you if you leave before examining everything fully.

Known Comp vs Post-comp walkthrough differences (this is largely for puzzles and does not cover changing location names, which are documented in the release notes)

General: Trizbort map included with release 3. Last Lousy Points at very end, in ROT13.

1 MANSE/MANOR:
  * release 2: the chimney is now available for escape. Gunter's options are different. Elmo's are too. Elmo is moved, as are the plaster and plates. Elmo has a tutorial.
  * release 3: Gunter does not stop by until you examine a few things. So you have more time to activate the two new areas, and you also can figure what you're supposed to be doing. Plus you are forced to talk to Gunter for an overview, but you can skip the rest. You can also freely flip diorama things but nothing else, but flipping something that should create an exit brings Gunter closer. Elmo's tutorial is tuned up.
  * release 4: MANOR is now MANSE. New LLP in the Gallery with the ISBN bins.
2 TROVES:
 * release 2: you now have a new possible action at the end in addition to dealing with the singer. Eddie C was not in release 1. The lager was also moved from the Very Top/Office. DIVORCES did not appear in release 1.
 * release 3: you had only one way to find the cellar (the direct way) in release 2. Now you have another. LLP with the book the guy gives you at the start. It's renamed, with an author, Peg A. Page. There's now a different puzzle to enter the skyscraper (PERNOD vs WEST)
 * release 4: the verbose babblings became a sob ever verbose, to make it clearer what to do. Two rooms were added. The Drain Nadir is an offshoot of Boredom Bedroom. The Roadbed and Sublet forked from the second room that kept changing its name. The skyscraper is now the godlings' lodgings. The Upscale Capsule is rearranged so the red vees are the first puzzle (IGNORE REGION became a general jump command) with Sister Tressi and Blamer Balmer at the end. The final puzzle, the Trance Nectar, is new, and Eddie C's song is sent to the Drain Nadir.
3 ROUTES:
  * release 4: optional ways through various areas are now disabled. The end puzzle is now in a room past the Cripple Clipper. The two mutually exclusive winning words are now both necessary, and there is an additional command, too. ABOARD is no longer a solution. The raptest patters are a new LLP.
4 PRESTO:
 * release 1 (deprecated) : Rickey is in Dirge Ridge instead of Rand.
 * release 2: Lawl Wall replaces Horned Hedron (moved to Oyster) with more sensible puzzle. You now need to summon a SUB or BUS at the end. Rand was Rickey. The Lawl Wall was not there. Many places are renamed.
 * release 3: some causality is fixed in this release. It may have more to do with the hints than the actual puzzles, but that should be clearer, now. The escaroles allow an alternative path to bring the yak over. You no longer have to read the textbook.
 * release 4: the HAWT THAW is now an LLP. The Volt Maze/Nowt Town now has two different ways to win, with the longer word getting more points. There are also three new last lousy points: one in the seminar and two in the shack.
5 OYSTER:
  * release 1 (deprecated) : you DESTROY Oyster D at the end and can pull the lever if you want. No yapper.
  * release 2: you can now do something with the sign in the initial area, and there's a new verb for you to get out, which relies on people there and not the bar name. Also, you need to get 3 of 5 verbs. The sign in the shore is gone, but the raft is visible and has a two-part solution with oars. You no longer need to ARRIVE--there's a better verb since there are boats. The portal moved from the plains to the hideout. You no longer need to SHAPE the heaps--the tubs, instead. The papery yapper is not present to bribe. The pills are now available to skip a puzzle. There is a side area to put an item to frame the walleyes less implausibly. There is also a side quest that starts in the Fishbowl and ends just before the final location, which is named differently. It involves wipes, waste, a lance, an ant and, optionally, the heaps, re-purposed. You also get killed a lot less by the haunter. The game gives a warning.
  * release 3: it's now 3 of 6 verbs to learn in the Hops Shop (renamed in release 2) though 2 relate to the jukebox, along with an LLP in the Handsome Sand Home (ex-fishbowl) (dent) and in the plains (general) with a LLP in Lean Lane. You also have another puzzle and location if you get on the boats (LEAP).
  * release 4: you now don't use the lever at all. You replace the pins. You can SPIN or SNIP them. The rude door was replaced by span-pans, which you need to SNAP at to get past.
6 TOWERS:
 * release 2: guardians are moved around, with the ingrates (more appropriate for the right word) replacing the yapper, who is optioned to the Oyster's final room where it makes more sense. The nebula now guards items in the topside. You must also get rid of both the prefect (swaps with pirates) and the deacons so the kid appears. The bonker is new as well. The sweatier wait-seer replaces the thug and clues the right word better. Many guardians are moved around. You could skip certain things with the kid before, like giving him the Gizmo, but you can't now.
 * release 3: the tavern was moved to the start, to give you a clearer idea what to do and give more of a storyline. You need to dispel three of six random guardians before Rodney goes, not 2 of 4, Daltho has his own room, and DYING is switched back from a solution to what it is. The nebula now guards Daltho's own room. You go back there instead of to the tavern. Andrew, Archie, Barney, Bredo, Dewey, Goldy, Marcel, Marlon (I didn't find the relatively simple code to override "normal,") Royce and Wade are also not present in the comp release. Most were in release 2 as well, though I'm too lazy to research which. RIP the slobb-blobs. The snider diners and natives are new, with greedy Ed Yerg replacing the greedy gnome. The atheists and yacker are new, too, with the serpent replacing the nebula. The yurts are now a last lousy point. Curst Palace now has a name--Castle Apcur.
 * release 4: the jetskis are gone, replaced by a bot boat, and you now ENTER BOAT to get where you need. The kid is also replaced by an Agnostic, whom you need to help to focus on what they always meant to do. The old puzzle (TENTATIVE) is now an LLP. The deacons are also replaced by a gender-specific guardian that clues the necessary letter collection better. The nameless salesmen were also moved to ambient scenery in the Clangier Clearing, in Others. The rewired robot is gone, replaced by the butlers, but it serves as an LLP elsewhere--sort of. Also, the stinger now defends the subsector after you've disposed of the bonker. The fluster-self rut is a new guardian, replacing the organised ego-drains, which are relegated to an LLP. The neural pulses are also replaced by the sporties' ripostes as an LLP. The keycar is relegated to LLP status, and the iPrune is renamed and moved to the end, replaced by the Resident Trendies. The Tetris Sitter replaces Ed Yerg, giving the puzzle a different flavor. Dreads Adders now block your way at the start. Sporties' ripostes are another LLP. Whew!
7 OTTERS
 * release 2: cinders now give a LLP or a hint. Merle and Elmer now clue a different LLP and clue it a bit better. You can now talk to Elvira, which is more just repartee before the final fight, but it does mean one more move.
 * release 3: the whistle shouldn't sound like it yelped. I repositioned the moat so it offered an additional, though trivial, barrier. Damsel became Gretta, and she added a dialogue. There's now a moat, which shouldn't be hard to ditch. You need to say QUICKLY before entering the Reclusion Inclosure.
  * release 4: I added yet a few more ways the macks were annoying, because it was fun for me. Added another LLP to irritate Elmer and Merle.
8 OTHERS was an added area for release 2, so there are really no comparisons from release 1 to release 2. Other than that I hid it for release 1 a week before the deadline because I realized it wasn't a good introduction, and I wanted to put it somewhere, but I didn't know where.
 * release 3: added persimmon and breadfruit. I forget if Curtis gave you the token right away in release 2, or you had to wait.
 * release 4: added coconuts and other fruits. New puzzle for tangerine, and melons/lemons each have their own word now.
9 DEMO DOME was added in release 3, so there are no comparisons before.
 * release 3: initial, and you just examine stuff.
 * release 4: testing helped improve the dome.
















































METRICS

The game has point totals for each region, but how do they compare in size? I decided to take a look at how many letters you needed to type in for the various anagrams. Despite running a script that counted keystrokes in walkthroughs, I likely made some niggling arithmetic errors here, so if you can correct them, I'd be happy. Big picture comments still stand, I think, and this is largely for curiosity. I also didn't account for using a hint item to reduce the minimum.

I think that this overview of complexity isn't fully accurate since complexity likely varies more as (letters ^ 2) or something. So a sum is not so useful. But this gives a bit extra to look at. If you're very interested, a heat map should be attached with this release. WMET.HTM is the file name, for "write metrics."

Ordeal Reload has a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 71. Find only one way out of the study and ignore the giant pin for the minimum score.

Stores has a minimum of 36 and a maximum of 67. It is 18 if you use the patcher. You have six stores to open. The Lectures quest gives 19, Store H gives 6, and Store B gives 6.

Store V has a minimum of 95 and a maximum of 138. The seven Last Lousy Points account for all the difference. There used to be alternate ways through, but not any more.

Store U has a minimum of 115 and a maximum of 129. The last lousy points give you seven letters each. It's debatable here whether U is harder than V. U clearly has fewer choices for words, but V may be a bit tougher to clear completely, since the optional points can get skipped.

Store P has a minimum of 132 and a maximum of 185. You can save a letter with the right good-bye to Leo and Rand. The lamb, TBA, starch charts and ROM sticks go, too, along with drives A and E. You can save 15 letters with the crust (volt maze, washups.) How you deal with Ye Hoop also means 4 or 6 letters. This has a moderate amount of points, but many solutions are relatively short. Again, the actual parts-of-speech make Store P's choice of words restricted--well, at least until the hacks' shack.

Store Y has a minimum of 130 and a maximum of 187. Many solutions are short words. The five-command side quest is a big one. You can spill the pills right away to "lose" 8 more letters.  You can add a few letters with the right bar actions, crossing the river the two-step way, and several LLPs.

Store W has a minimum of 157-161 and a maximum of 316-318, subjected to some randomness. Both the "H" and "I" paths through the guardians are 36 letters. You can save keystrokes, too. Fussier vs. unlocked. The tavern may take an extra keystroke or two since one group of enemies has 4 or 5 letters, and another has 7 or 8. That makes for the estimates in the totals. The warriors are randomly determined at the start of the game, so you can't undo to get easier ones. You can skip a lot, like three of the warriors, the strudel, the denim and other LLPs and, of course, five central guardians and two outlying ones. But even at a minimum, W has you solve more letters than some store maximums. Combined with a big map, you can see why this is the toughest region.

Store T has a minimum of 145 and a maximum of 209. The bran barn forces you to use one more letter, and you can LLP Elmer and Merle twice, pick off the vow here and final animal in the preserve and realm, and get rid of the cinders. Also, you can pick the long options for the shrewin' whiners (19) vs the minimum (16) or decide whether to pick the long option for the imp (16). The macks also can swing from 22 to 31. There's randomness with the adverbs given but not their length. Also, this range is not fully representative of the difficulty, since you can deduct a lot of points for when letters end in LY. That drops it to 123 to 178.

Store H has a minimum of 160 and a maximum of 321. But its theme is easy enough, I think, that it shouldn't be too tough.

LAST LOUSY POINTS

Note that I'm not really going to address cases like finding 3/3 things when you only need 2/3 or, in OTHERS, where you can avoid flipping a lot of fruits. Or all the guardians in Towers, where you can leave three of the seven alone. Those should be in the walkthrough, because they can all potentially help you solve the game. These are stand-alone points which are utterly unnecessary to solving things and, in fact, can't really help you go forward. Often they will seem superfluous or even slightly hidden.

Hints are in ROT13. If you aren't sure what ROT13 is, or you don't want to do the translation in your head, it can be translated at ROT13.com.

MANOR:

FAVO for the ISBN bins.

STORES:

FBEORG from Store B. Note that the side trip to Cruelest Lectures means 3 extra points, and doing so gives you a hint item.

PRESTO:

OYNZ scares the lamb. But only enough to send it safely home!

JUNG gets rid of the hawt thaw. (Neat ROT13, eh?)

The trim socks become EBZ FGVPXF--no space needed. The last letter is optional, too. The escaroles become PNFFREBYR. This allows an alternate way through.

You can say CEBFG to the sport ports.

Drive A and Drive E can also be enhanced. Drive A becomes NIVQRE, while you can QREVIR ways to improve Drive E.

ROUTES:

Go GBJNEQF the worst ad.

You can also be JVGUBHG the raptest patters.

TROVES:

TNCR at Simple Impels by Peg A. Page.

TYNER at the lager (again, interesting ROT13.)
QVFPBIRE something about Divorces magazine. There actually is a magazine named this LLP, and it's pretty well-known. Or it was. It's much less fluffy than Divorces.

Note that troves has a few 1-of-2 puzzles, where you may or may not skip to the next area after getting one of them, and you may or may not be able to solve both. For instance, Sister Tressi and the Marble Blamer. These are listed in the walkthrough.

Which are they? The live bee/senora, lobster/stream, blamer/sister, and praise spirea/rivets.

TOWERS:

Note that five of the guardians can be left alone. They aren't covered below. Similarly, three of the warriors can be left alone.

In the Scope Copse:
The Try Us Yurts can be LHEGF.

Next to the Baldest Blasted Saltbed:
The docile old ice can be PBVYRQ.

Next to the Unblest Sunbelt:
CEBFVRFG for the sporties' ripostes.

In the Treading Gradient:
The mended mini denim can be ZVARQ for a new pastry.
The replay player can be CRNEYL.

Once you've cleared everything in one of the main square, a keycar appears. It can become PERNXL.

In the otherwise inconsequential corner areas:
The strudel in Fringe Finger can be EHFGYRQ for an extra point, though you can just take it.
The organised ego drains in Lost Lots can be TENAQVBFR.

The Coasting Agnostic can also be made NGGRAGVIR in the Subsector.

You can even fix the boat a bit more in Actionless Coastlines. The weirder red wire can be ERJVERQ.

Across Leak Lake, there is the quest for the flowerpot. The pester'n serpent can become CERFRAG, the unripe ur-pine can become CHAVRE, and the Tetris Sitter can become GEVFGR.

You also get a final last lousy point for ABG HFVAT K-ENL IVFVBA. VS LBH NGR N CNFGEL LBH PNA FGVYY TRG GUVF CBVAG.

OYSTER:

FPNA the cans in Hardest Trashed Dearths. If you leave to Lean Lane, this LLP will not be available.

GRAQ the dent.
FCYNVA in the plains.
ERIRY by the lever.

Side quest:
FJVCR wipes, FJRNG (over waste,) PYRNA lance, FUNCR heaps (not necessary for the quest but not available without it,) GNA ant.

OTTERS:

As in Troves and Towers, multiple passages through mean that solving one way makes other puzzles LLPs. There are two ways to get your powers back, which get two points, and you have an extra animal in Lamer Realm and Perverse Preserve. That makes four of seven.

You can ERFPVAQ the cinders instead of using them for a clue.

There are also two ways to annoy Elmer and Merle.
UBARFGYL is in tune with the area's theme, an -LY adverb.
But Elmer and Merle are also ideas aides and can thus be (temporarily) NFVQR.

OTHERS:
Don't use the arugula to "guru" any item successfully.
