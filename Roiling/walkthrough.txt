Hello there! This is my walkthrough for A Roiling Original, a sequel to Shuffling Around. I hope you're just reading this due to a lack of time, or curiosity about a point you may have missed, and not due to frustration. Whatever the case, you don't need to have played Shuffling Around to solve A Roiling Original. There are some references to Shuffling Around, but they shouldn't distract from the story too much. The big ones? Nat Egam, gateman, helped you at the start of your journey to defeat Red Bull Burdell. In Shuffling Around, you changed things to other things. In A Roiling Original, well ... you will see.

Whether you just want to make sure you missed a silly gag, or you're stuck on a specific section, welcome I hope this walkthrough helps without spoiling too much! I wanted to try to weave the story in without making it too big, so you didn't feel like you were just typing commands, or maybe you could see one last hint before revealing the answer.

If you're wondering about how to figure things out, especially when the settler pops up question marks, logic.htm will do a better job. (TLDR: question marks usually help you, if you think about them right!)

I've semi-hidden some Last Lousy Points to give you one more chance at getting them on your own and also to focus on th walkthrough. They are at the very end. You can cut and paste text to ROT13.com for those.

If you're a bit more worried about spoilers, you may want the HTML version, which has expandable InvisiClues. These should both have similar content, and they should be in the bundle with this file and the game file.

If you're the technical type, you can use the command

type roil-thru.txt | grep -iE "^>" | sed "s/^>//g"

Or, since I label some alternate paths with (ALT),

type roil-thru.txt | grep -iE "^.ALT. >" | sed "s/^>//g"

To delete my comments and have a list of commands you can cut and paste. You can also replace ^[^>].* with nothing and \r\n\r\n with \r\n if you have a text editor that accepts regular expression replacement. This will zap everything without a > to start, then lump the lines together.

Also, using periods between commands is possible, but only for directions. The "special" commands for this game cause the Inform parser a lot of problems. My programming found no way to correct this, and it was fixed in a later version of Inform, too late for me to port my project over.

Any comments on this game, or transcripts, can go to blurglecruncheon@gmail.com. While I've tested to tackle the big stuff, bugs slip through--and hopefully they are not too much. But any help from a transcript is appreciated, for matters subjective or objective. My pre- and post- comp testers found a lot of stuff, but that sometimes just reveals other hidden problems.

Conversely you can also report issues at https://github.com/andrewschultz/stale-tales-slate/ and they don't have to be in any professional format or anything. I'd appreciate typos/stylistic stuff being lumped together, but other than that, individual bugs--or feature requests--that aren't obviously similar can be chopped up. The organization would be up to me.

This walkthrough is for version 4 of the game, which I recommend, as the puzzles and cluing make much more sense, and the hints are more detailed. Major differences in the walkthrough are labeled at the end. Version 4's main changes are different room names, and NPCs may be named differently. Some are female if you are. But the abstract puzzles have mostly not changed, except where I thought I found one clearly more sensible.

For those who played the (long-ago) comp version and want to see the new area(s) at the end, you can skip to that area to see the command to start the game with before you chat with Gunter. The implication being, the knocker's come back to snivel his way into your good graces.

You can also access the new area(s) that appeared in releases 2 and 3 by playing through the game proper, but I think a shortcut is fair, since the game is rather long. And, in the case of the comp release, more abstruse and occasionally unfair.

So ... ROVE OVER and DEMO DOME MODE don't actually spoil any of the game's main puzzles.

  Thanks,
  Andrew Schultz

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recommend that you search for the section you want to visit--this document is divided that way. The stores are organized in alphabetical order in the list below, but the walkthrough displays them in approximate order of difficulty (V, U, P, Y, W) before going to the final one (T) and postscript (H). I put in whitespace so one store doesn't spoil the next.

ORDEAL RELOAD
STORE P WALKTHROUGH
STORE T WALKTHROUGH
STORE U WALKTHROUGH
STORE V WALKTHROUGH
STORE W WALKTHROUGH
STORE Y WALKTHROUGH
STORE H WALKTHROUGH

Also, for release 3, I wrote up some metrics of how big areas are. More details should be included in metrics.htm.

The ORDEAL RELOAD has three separate minimal ways to leave your Means Manse. I'll list them all.

You need to do semi-constructive things so that Gunter bugs you and you have a chance to see the game's mechanics. There are a lot of things you can do, like try to figure something or look at your notepad. Seven, to be precise.

> X BOOKS
> X CHAIR
> GET NOTEPAD
> X ADS

May be the most natural way, though a quicker way is

> LAMP
> X ADS

or

> X BOOKSHELF
> THINK

The isolani liaison is really just a fancy name for a door. Yorpwald is like that.

> OPEN DOOR
> 1
(None of the other options are important, but they add color and clues, if you want them.)

> 5

You fall asleep and then wake up. How do you get a light source?

> LAMP

Oh! You found something.

> X LATCHES

And there's something in the latches! The teariest treatise from Gateman Nat Egam is a hint. More precisely, the letters in the letter. Which contains a recoded decoder -- or a revised deviser. There's a pattern here to the anagrams, with only the first and last letters switched, so the latches become a...

> SATCHEL

(This can be done later. But if you put it off, you can't exit your home until you figure it out.)

The giant pin is a last lousy point. It is probably harder than the three ways out, which it clues. I'll save it and other LLPs for the end.

Now to get out of your study. There are three ways. First, the tables.

> STABLE
> IN

The sitar is as useless as a hole in the ground.

> STAIR
> D

Now, you can go OUT to go back and pick up all the points if you want. You can skip down to "how to get out?" if you don't want maximum points. "My niche" looks suspicious.

> GT STUDY

(Note: you can GO TO/GT somewhere available if you want to shave off a few turns. Sometimes it might not save keystrokes, but it saves thought.)

> CHIMNEY
> UP

The pram has plenty of clues, like Mr. Pa in red.

> RAMP
> D

Now you can go back out again one last time to get full points.

The third way is to examine the beams. Ten of them!

> GT STUDY

> BASEMENT
> D

You can't go IN right now, as the game tells you to look at the settler. So,

> X SETTLER

Mess around with what you want. There's a tutorial anyway in a bit. Two, actually.

You can also do something with the ISBN bins. That's a last lousy point, so I'll ignore it here. It's an odd word, but there are only twenty-two possibilities. Well, six if you use the settler. And actually, in cheat mode, the settler lets you deduce the answer logically.

> IN

Oh no. You're under the gun. Err, the rifle. But Mole Elmo doesn't seem to want to attack you! In fact, he's gesturing for you to change his rifle.

> FLIER

You get to talk to Mole Elmo, now. He gives hints. The commands below are the quickest. If you listen to him complain, it's for your amusement only.

> 3
> Y

Or, to get basic hints,
(ALT) >2
(ALT) >2
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1

Elmo's information about the stores is purley background stuff. You may find it worthwhile.

(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1
(ALT) >1

Now, Elmo's complaints may be funny, or they may not. Let's skip them for now.

(ALT) >2

So now you're in the carven cavern. At any time, you can deal with the Respect Specter for a bonus point that is intended, not as a huge puzzle, but as a tutorial for the letters settler on cheat mode and its ambiguous readings.

There are palest pastel plates.

> STAPLE

What goes with a staple? Well, you can remake the plaster psalter.

> STAPLER

The act-ruin curtain looks like lined paper, so you can just...

> PUT STAPLE IN STAPLER
> STAPLE CURTAIN

> IN

The Strip of Profits is the central hub of the rest of the game. There are a lot of stores, but the game should note which are the most interesting for your purposes. You need to complete a very minimum of two of them to be able to open up Store T. You can use the item that falls out after two wins to "ZAP" the other stores--or the portals you created from them--in order to skip them. But one way or another, the Trips Strip must be clear of portal stores before you enter Store T.




















































The basic flow of the game, then, is as follows.

ordeal reload -> stores -> 2 of (p u v w y) if you use the patcher -> t. K/N is an optional puzzle we'll go through now. It's optional because of the slang involved and because it's a silly, minor joke.

Also, if you are curious about the main "theme" of each store, I have it in ROT13 below.

The optional stores are organized alphabetically, so you may wish to search for store (letter). The exception: H can't be opened until you defeat Elvira, so I put it at the end.

You will get a warning before solving an area if you can still gain a few points. But you may have shut yourself out from getting the maximum. One way to track this is by toggling possible score notification with POSS.

Below is a ROT13'd list of the themes of each store. The stores are organized in approximate orders of difficulty and length. There may be debate as to which of U and V are tougher. U has fewer possibilities for words and was, for a while, smaller than the minimum path through V. But V has more optional points and a greater pool of possible words. Similarly, there may be debate as to which of store Y and P is tougher. Testers seemed to find Y easier because there were so many short puzzles and also because, at some point, P switched back to nouns.

Spoilers below.

V = cnffvir ireof
U = cercbfvgvbaf
Y = npgvir ireof
P = vagrewrpgvbaf
W = nqwrpgvirf
T = nqireof




















































Stores K and N form a silly puzzle which is not necessary, so you may want to skip it. And while I said I put most LLPs at the end, I'll reverse myself here, since the Strip of Profits is not a big area.

Store K can be entered. Store N holds someone. They are related.

NESTOR is the guy in store N.

> NESTOR

TOKERS are the people in store K.

> TOKERS

> ENTER STEAMING

You need a weird word here. One that could be more than one figure of speech.

> OUTSIDE

And you get something for later. The nice mush munchies let you use the slider more often. Testers didn't use the slider much, but it gives you an additional hint. If you guess an anagram all wrong, it stays silent. If you guess one letter right, it cues you there. You can even purposely try nonsense guesses to see if any letters are right.












































STORE V WALKTHROUGH

STORE V holds troves. Troves of riches! The sort you have to think and earn! It has the fewest mandatory puzzles to win, though STORE U has fewer maximum puzzles. Store V is very one-way. There are seven rooms as you move from poverty to the very top. Many of the optional points occur when you only need to solve one of two puzzles to advance. When this happens, I will list them both. Neither is "better" than the other.

> TROVES

The portal name doesn't matter, but I hope you find my choices amusing. In fact, if there is just one, you can go IN to save keystrokes.

> ENTER TASTEE ESTATE

The Loather Rathole.

Oh, look, you get a self-help book about thinking right! And how, if you think right, doing the right thing will come naturally. You're paralyzed by the hustle and bustle of the city and all that modernist stuff.

Or, more reductively, you can get a last lousy point from Peg A. Page's book at any time.

You've been kicked out of Eh, At Heat. Since the game mentions you can't do anything actively, and you need warmth and heat, you can...

> HATE

Oh no! Hate blinded you to your wallet getting stolen! But you can't visit the Race Acre because you don't feel up to it, yet. So you need to ...

> CARE

So you've made it to the Boarded Roadbed. There's the stop post, but you can't inspect it with the sob ever verbose distracting you.

There's a last lousy point with the sty.

> OBSERVE
> SPOT

This helps you move on a bit to the Boarded Roadbed, but oh no! An evil bee, so near! You only need to turn it into a vile bee. Do both and it's a live bee. So either of the two below will work. You can also deal with the SNORE SO ARENA. Both verbs are polar opposites but both equally valuable to positive thinking, you see.

> BELIEVE
or
(ALT) > REASON

Doing both gets you an extra point.

Now the cellar caller the bee was on is broken. It would get help you find the cellar pretty easily. So you need to think things out yourself.

> RECALL

So now you're in the Drain Nadir.

You've hit rock bottom, and you need to bring yourself up. If you want, you can take a flap at Sister Tressi, but you don't need to.

> DESPAIR

You've hit rock bottom. Time to pull yourself up a bit...the tune from Eddie C will help. The lyrics combining with the notes.

> DECIDE

Boredom Bedroom! You may be able to figure what to do with the lager, which is another Last Lousy Point.

You need to do one of the two below to have confidence you can move beyond the Boredom Bedroom. There's the BORTLES lobster and the ME ARTS stream.

> MASTER
or
> BOLSTER

(or both, for a bonus point!)

Now, you are THAT close to believing you can lead, but not quite. That book by Dale Elda and Leda Adle may help.

> DEAL

From the Browse Bowers, Si Reed and the See Dir give you a clue that you need somewhere better to reside.

> DESIRE

In the Econ-Cone, you need to enter the godlings' lodgings. But it's for people who are the very best, because they wanted to be. Either side of the status, there's something. The rivets saying TREVIS VISTER and the Praise Spirea.

> ASPIRE
or
(ALT) > STRIVE
(or both, for a bonus point!)

Hm, that END PRONER POD needs to be avoided somehow. You can't enter the lodgings until you ignore it properly.

> PONDER

Wow! An office. But it's not properly stocked for being Numero Uno. Just the red vees.

> DESERVE

DIVORCES magazine is a bonus point.

What to do now? To be worth your salt? Or the St. Al Salt?

> LAST

Now to stop needing to be super-productive, despite either the Marble Blamer or Sister Tressi Siters watching you.

> RAMBLE
or
(ALT) > RESIST
(or both, for a bonus point!)

You're tired. There's that Trance Nectar which can help you be more productive. It's totally different from the Large Regal Lager! But you still don't want to drink it. One last action or thought will help you break free.

> RECANT















































STORE U is the one with the fewest puzzles needed to get a maximum score.

> ROUTES

The Worst Ad is a Last Lousy Point. It's not necessary, so I won't spoil it here. You probably will guess it, since there are only so many words it can be, based on the words you use here. You can guess it at any time before you leave the Same Mesa for good, unless a certain someone is distracting you.

> ENTER COURSE SOURCE

What is going on here? You can't go in any direction. They don't make sense. And you can't even easily enter the places listed. Perhaps the scripture picturers provide a clue. They say three different things.

> INSIDE

Ah, there we go. Something a little more formal for a place of worship.

> X LIST

Hmm, a list of stuff on the wall. Maybe the stuff is in the other locations.

> EXIT

If you examine the anti-sag sit-a-nag, it's a giant's. That wraps up what the anagram letters should be. Gast, the giant, is Ian or Nia based on if you chose male or female.

> AGAINST

Climb up near the side art and hear Gast's tirades.

> ASTRIDE

Hide from the WOE BOW BELL and its noise.

> BELOW

Rude 'N Nuder?

> UNDER

Hooray! The first reagent.

How to get into Pat's?

> PAST

And what to do about the seed pit?

> DESPITE

Yay, a stupor sprout. The second reagent!

> EXIT

Oscar's?

> ACROSS

How to get the pipe soot, the final reagent?

> OPPOSITE

> EXIT

> IN (INSIDE is not necessary now that you've gained the priest's trust)
> EXIT

Okay. A Bev O' Be Ova' clues you to a direction.

> ABOVE

Oh no! A MORF-FORM! Maybe you can't change it, but you can change WHERE it is.

> FROM

How do you get the crowd to help you where to go next, around the bean?

> BENEATH

The Harms Marsh is unlit.

> UNTIL

So you need to find an un-road.

> AROUND

And No-Lag Logan.

> ALONG

The admits-mist ad is hiding something, as is Da Mist.

> AMIDST

Now, on the boat, Logan's notes give you a clue.

> ATHWART

The sonancy canyon has a lot of noises. First, deal with the bent ewe. Make her feel safer from the hurt hog.

> BETWEEN

Now help the hurt hog.

> THROUGH

There's a chance for the LLP with the patters. Not changing them but their content. Or you can just deal with the yob den to seal the deal.

> BEYOND

That will do it! Since you've solved two store regions, you can now zap stores with the patcher or switch the patcher to reach Otters, if you wish to skip to the end of the game.













































STORE Y seems to be something underwater-ish. There are more points to gain than in STORE P, but guessing the right words seem easier. I find it ironic that the "guess the verb" area seemed to have caused testers the least frustration. Perhaps having to ask "what do I do next" automatically makes people think of verbs, too. I don't know.

In a case where a verb can take an object, you should get a point for either command, e.g. PASTE TAPES or PASTE should both work. I won't label all the cases here.

> OYSTER
> ENTER BALANCER BARNACLE

Okay, you're in an action-packed bar. It's totally action-filled, and you need to take evasive action. But first, how to get in there?

You can do something with the sign, which hints what sort of words can be used here. It's a last lousy point. The pills can also help you skip a puzzle if you SPILL them.

Still, it looks like you need to get rid of the trolls to start. They're there to keep people in, suggesting they do belong there, or haven't done enough. You need to perform three of six actions to annoy people at the Posh Hops Shop.

> SING
> SPIT
> INSET

(Note: these are the other possibilities. Don't go in for 4, or the trolls will get you. Well, unless you want to see the randomized death messages.)
(ALT) > UNSET/REMAP (each of these destroys the tunes/perma-amper, so they are mutually exclusive)
(ALT) > SCRAPE

Note that you don't need to provide an object with these verbs, or any of the verbs you need to win this area. Yes, this section means active verbs. It's a(nother) guess-the-verb section!

And the next verb to guess is, how to get away from the trolls, coolly?

> STROLL

Stupid clam. Won't settle down.

> CALM

You're stuck in the olde lode, and you can't walk away from the urn! Not in any direction!

> RUN

Well now, how do you arrive past a river? There are boats, and there is a raft. The canoe is a red herring, and it can change to something that won't help you at all. In fact, it gives an InstaDeath.

> BOAST

And you'll be picked up. You then need to get out...

> LEAP

(However, you can also enter the raft, propel it and use the oars, for an extra point)

(ALT) > ENTER RAFT
(ALT) > FART
(ALT) > SOAR

Lots of violence in Anger Range. First things first. Protect that trout! Two ways. Either opens up the east.

> SCRAP (the CARPS) or
(ALT) > SPIKE (the pikes)

> E

The eeks are loud. Someone's upset the trout is hurt! (And yes, the cans are a last lousy point. I bet you can guess, though if you leave without changing them, you can't come back.)

> SEEK

Teach the trout to not get beaten up later.

> TUTOR

Now Aunt Tuna is happy. Reward in the drawer! You can also fix the dent for a last lousy point. Again, it's not a hard one, I hope. I think.

You can get the wipes if you want. They lead to a side quest I will detail at the end.

But you want to be a good guest. The tea-at-a-tee should be pretty straightforward.

> EAT TEA

You will not be surprised to learn that you will find the other half of the paler pearl later. In fact, you could do so in short order now. But it's slightly quicker to go somewhere else first.

> W

> N

At any time here in the plains you can just sound off for a LLP based on the location name. There are a few silly guesses, too, that the game responds to.

Your first order of business is to stop getting hit by a crate.

> TRACE
> REACT

Ah, that'll do it.

> KISS SKIS
> BONK KNOB

Okay, now to deal with the span pans.

> SNAP

> IN

The tubs are probably hiding something.

> BUST

The prod needs something simple to jar and open it. It's a command that's generally pointless in the game, except now.

> DROP

There's something under the waste and another LLP once you deal with the waste. But this walkthrough is about getting through the game. So let's go west of the plains.

> OUT

> S

> W

That sardine is nosey but sensitive to noise.

> WARP

Did you examine the arches?

How about examining more thoroughly? Some games force you to do this instead of EXAMINE to find everything, which is a nuisance. But I hope it "works" here.

> SEARCH ARCHES

The two paler pearls fit to become a general gleaner...which is too small to read. Fortunately, that's only temporary!

> ENLARGE
> X GLEANER

This will help later.

> N

The weaselly walleyes are watching you and not watching you. Maybe you can frame them.

> W

Ah, the Rascal Craals. Imagine if someone or something found the ruby here. They'd know who to suspect, amirite?

> BURY

With the ruby buried, you can summon the ghost in Anger Range, now.

> E
> S
> E

You can maybe save time if not keystrokes with...

(ALT) > GT ANGER

Okay, you need to dig up the spirit...

> UNEARTH

What's this? It's a sausage? Well, there's only one way to calm it down.

> ASSUAGE

> W
> N
> W

(ALT) > ASK SAUSAGE ABOUT RUBY

...this shows it where the ruby was! You framed the weaselly walleyes. The ghost scares them away.

You shouldn't need to go...

> E

The Ol' Trap needs to be disarmed, somehow, but you're not sure where the disarming device is.

> PATROL

You find a portal behind it!

> IN

Now there is a rather long side quest. You need to have a shiny lance. This quest spans two areas.

The Templar Ramplet accounts for three points: figuring how to climb it, beating the enemy behind, and performing the right action in the side area.

The lever can also be used or, rather, not used for a bonus point. But here is what you need to do in the Tenfold Teflon'd Loft/Den.

The papery yapper is adamant you can't bribe it, as such. Let's find a euphemism!

> PREPAY

Oh dear! You need to do something with the dialer.

> DERAIL

That's a warning from Elvira! You could call back, but the pins are in the way at the moment.

> SPIN PINS

Note: you can't SNIP them. You don't have anything surgical enough. Now to bug Elvira again.

> REDIAL

This solves the Oyster area.




















































STORE P can be transformed and entered, too.

> PRESTO

You can eat the curst crust for a clue in the next zone. The crust will make you Say Stuff.

> ENTER ODORANT TORNADO

That lamb is too scared to move. Or not scared enough. It is a last lousy point but not a hard one. The maze has two solutions: a cheap short one and a cheap long one.

Can't get over the hump to the west?

> UMPH

There is the hoop--or ye hoop--but if you jump for it, you can't bring yourself to drop your possessions.

> POOH

Or, for an extra point,

(ALT) > PHOOEY

You can't do anything with the angrier earring for a long while, but it's not too heavy, and it'll be useful later.

> E
> S

How to get the star?

> RATS

What to do for the dart?

> DRAT

> S

Oh no! Leo is too big to beat physically. Rope-a-dope time.

> OLE

Hmm, a guy named Rand, a lot like Leo.

> DARN

That wasn't too bad! But they might be good in another fight. Be nice to them, now. They aren't really washups. Talk to them if you want, then...

> WHASSUP

The sods gone odes song can be repelled for an LLP.

> N
> N

The volt maze is not worth going through manually. You can solve it just reading the zany meter and seeing the maze's name. Or, just notice the name of the rooms and say to yourself, I really don't want to go through!

This isn't technically an interjection, but it can be said like one. Hence, it doesn't deserve full points. The interjection that gets full points is a bit longer.

> WONT

But if you want full points, first examine the sign for some red clues (Volt Maze, EZ Ol Av TM.) If you want to look through the maze, you meet a guy named Zo Mavelt, then Tom Avlez, then Lev Tzoma. The maze also goes from L to V. It also has a brand name, and touching the walls makes you see red. The scanner may be necessary, too, though altogether you have enough clues for...

(ALT) > MAZELTOV

Space or no space! You can't deal with what replaced the maze yet (note if you go north you get in a fight,) but let's worry about that later.

If you try going north, you still get smoked. Even if you know what to do with the ether. Your leadership skills--and some items--may help later. Get rid of the plebe.

> BLEEP
> E

Now you can do something with the Sport Ports for a last lousy point. It's an obscure and foreign-ish word, and in fact it's an interjection I didn't know until I started really poking around, but it turned up and felt appropriate.

The boing-go bin needs fixing.

> BINGO
> PUT DART IN POPGUN
> W
> N

Hmm, fight to the north through ether. How to rally your friends?

> THERE

> N

Oh no! Saps' Pass looks tricky. The hogs! And the keys! Fake them out with...

> SYKE
or
(ALT) > GOSH

Neither is better than the other.

Now Saps' Pass is the Phat Path. But now you need to ditch Rand and Leo, who want to visit the shack. Three ways--choose two.

> LATER
> TOUGH
or
(ALT) > SO LONG

Oh, you can deal with that hawt thaw if you want, too, but it's a last lousy point. It was an extremely badly clued puzzle in version 1, so it's a sort of inside joke with myself.

I think it's far less opaque now. You probably can figure what to do.

Trickier are the Starch Charts. They signal a change from interjections to something else. They are a LLP, and a bit of an obscure one.

> N

The angrier earring becomes something new, something too heavy to carry.

Read the schematic catechism a few times if you want--I sort of generated a lot of doctor names from a script. And some of the longer anagrams were fun. Originally, it was part of the puzzle to fix up the computer, but that felt convoluted. The game is convoluted enough, so now it's just a silly prop to hold more anagrams.

The trim socks are a last lousy point. This one is not meant to be easy, but if you know about computer hardware, maybe it is.

The escaroles provide an optional way to save a turn on a puzzle later. They are another last lousy points.

You can also twiddle Drive A and Drive E.

So what is necessary?

The Clack Ops Locs Pack is useless in its present form.

> CAPS LOCK

Everlasting gum?

> MUG

Giant flea?

> LEAF

You will, later, need fuel for thought.

> COLA

And a place to rest.

> FUTON

Disk with a reversible compression algorithm? Portability?

> SKID
> PUSH SKID S
> G
> G

The drab yoke looks like...a keyboard. But how to get the yak to move?

> PUT LEAF ON SKID

If you changed the escaroles,

(ALT) > PUSH SKID S

or

(ALT) > S

> PUSH SKID N
> G
> G

Okay. So the YrNet Entry detached the drab yoke from the yak.

> KEYBOARD

Okay, put it all together.

> DISK
> PUT DISK IN DRIVE
> PUT KEYBOARD ON TABLE
> PUT CAPS LOCK IN KEYBOARD

The TBA key is optional. But obviously, it will save time if you change it to what it should be. This is considerably easier than the ROM sticks.

Now for a monitor. The N-E-Recs Censer...

> SCREEN
> PUT SCREEN ON TABLE

The Be-Troo E-Robot has one job. It's simple, but you can't do it.

> REBOOT

Slipping on peels? Probably use the futon.

> SLEEP

Read the polemic again.

> COMPILE

Oh no! It works, but it doesn't work right. It won't...BUDGE.

> DEBUG

Okay, how to get out of here? The USB must be really universal, because it can also be two things...

> SUB (or...)
(ALT) > BUS

(As with other multiple-choice verbs, neither option is better than the other. Though you can undo and try the other for slightly different text.)

















































STORE W has the most puzzles, with some of the longest words, but a ton of them are optional. Also, you can figure what to do with the Curst Palace Castle Apcur right away, but you still have to get close to perform your magic effectively.

Also, I will get rid of all the guardians in the main three-by-three area even though you only need to take down seven. You need access to the corners and center and to clear the northeast.

The GT command may be particularly useful here to save dealing with longer tasks and treks.

> TOWERS
> ENTER TRUSTER TURRETS

Now, a clue is what the towers inspired. Adjectives. You've got a bunch of prosaic picaros to deal with here in the Trefoil. Seven, to be exact, though you only need to get rid of four, including Rodney. Rodney's babble should give you a clue as to what to do.

Since Rodney is the leader, you can't get rid of him until two or fewer others are left. You get no penalty for leaving someone, and you get no reward for clearing everything beyond just points. The enemies appear at random, and they are chosen from pods of five or so to ensure that they're not randomly too long or too short overall. I've listed each of the prosaic picaros in alphabetical order.

Okay. The dreads adders. They sure seem confident! Make them feel a bit less aggressive.

> SADDER

Also, if you want, you can

(XTR) > GET START TARTS
(XTR) > GET TOASTER

The toaster allows you to eat stuff which can XRAY stuff you need to look at. Though with this walkthrough, you won't need it.

The next part doesn't need to be ALL done. You can deep-six all but, uh, five of the guardians. (Leave an H shape. Or an I--H rotated by 90 degrees. And you need to clear both guardians in the Actionless Coastline.)

> N

If you want to see a map in the Scope Copse,

> X SCOPE

It updates in the top window as you knock off guardians. You can check this after your first challenges.

The Try-Us Yurts are an LLP. It's not meant to be difficul;t.

Those bluster butlers are guarding something important, but maybe you can make them better butlers. You can't do anything west, yet, but let's get them out of the way.

> SUBTLER

You won't win a fight with someone muscly.

> CLUMSY

The snider diners are sure you can't get past them. The dry wit!

> RINSED

North or east doesn't really matter, but let's go east first. It's slightly shorter.

By the way, the yacker keycar that appears here? It actually appears in the first non-Coastlines place that is free of guardians. It's possible to clear the area without seeing the keycar, but not very. The keycar is an LLP. To avoid it altogether, you could avoid changing Muscly, the wait-seer, the reed's ale deal seer, the trendies, and the drained arid den. This is probably harder to work out than just disposing of a few more guardians, but in case you were wondering, it is possible.

> E

"SMH, Life" Mel Fish is not Flemish. He just wants to be...

> HIMSELF

The dandier arid den won't let you pass without purchasing some of that Nerd-Aid! But you don't have any money.

> DRAINED

> N

The weeds are free to move until they're...

> SEWED

You can do something with the denim, too. Another Last Lousy Point. They're all over the Towers.

The fluster-self rut leaves you agitated.

> RESTFUL

The sweatier wait-seer blocks you with patience.

> WEARIEST

The Reed's Ale vendor (differs if you're male or female) can't decide if he should stay or go. To break Lars/Else free from obligations,

> RELEASED

(ALT) > RESEALED (to get Lars's/Elsa's costume to fit)

Now whether you are facing Lois the Hostile or the Hostile-is-He Lot, they really need to become much, much nicer.

The REB-NOK Bonker is working fine until it's...

Oh no! But a grin-set stinger takes its place! And it's active! There must be something important behind!

> RESTING

> E

Dr. Yow is imprisoned and can't talk until you make the good Doctor ...

You'll need Dr. Yow's voice for later.

> PUSH RETAPE

Dr. Yow can also be something else, but you don't need that, yet.

> W

> N

> N

The atheists are all nice and slow and patient, until you disrupt them a bit.

> HASTIEST

We can help the Coasting Agnostic a bit. They'll help us later. But first, make Reading: a Dinger completely unpalatable.

> GRAINED

> W

The Resident Trendies are too cool to let you past.

> NERDIEST

> W

Now there are three guardians. We only need to clear one. The mardier admirer.

> MARRIED

Let's clear the traipse pirates so we aren't blocked. They are ruddier than you. Maybe you need to make it so they need a tan.

> PASTIER

Now you can detour for an LLP. There are two ways to take the Strudel in Lost Lots.

The duck hears Dr. Yow's voice, and that establishes trust.

The fries-us fissure can be messed with, and so can the luck node.

(ALT) > GT AGNOSTIC

The Coasting Agnostic is engrossed in a faux-intellectual book. Let's give 'em something better to do by making the book less palatable.

> GRAINED

> TELL AGNOSTIC ABOUT YOW

(There are other ways to do this, but this is the most straightforward...I think.)

The Coasting Agnostic's still having a little trouble concentrating, but nothing big. Tentative. LLP time!

Now for something to listen to that's interesting.

> ROWDY

Science! It's so exciting!

> W
> N
> N

Incidentally, you can do something with the raves saver, since it calls itself a replay player. It's a purely aesthetic LLP.

> GIVE GIZMO TO AGNOSTIC

Now there are two ways to do things. You can repair the boat all the way, or you fix it one way and get stuck in the water. Each way gives the same amount of points. If you want, you can also fix the weirder red wire first.

> STABLER
> ROBUST

If you only do one, you go to Rawest Waters, where the Earnest Eastern Neaters want to help you, but you have to help yourself.

(ALT) > NEAREST

Now, in the mislit limits, you can straight-out win the game. But what if you want to help Renato's quest? This is self-contained enough, I'll spoil these optional points.

> PUNIER

Oh no! Nastier stainer retinas!

> ANTSIER

The crocus goes in the top opt pot. But now the Pester'n Serpent won't let go until you make it just...

> W

The Tetris Sitter is waiting for you. But she is very disconnected.

Give her the top opt pot, and she will give you hints if you go in and out.

> GIVE POT TO SITTER

> E

Now, to win the whole deal.

> SPECTACULAR

========================================================


















































STORE T is the final store.

> OTTERS
> ENTER OTTERS

You can manage only the weakest type of words. What is the weakest part of speech? The adverb!

You need to get rid of that barley.

The former yielder speaks boomingly.

The cinders are a bonus point. DISCERN will help you get a free pass anywhere, or...well, the other is a Last Lousy Point.

How to help Gretta ward off the parleys splayer players? There are seven things they say, divided into pods. You have 7-word and 8-word adverbs with and without repeating letters, 9-word adverbs, 10-word adverbs, 11-word adverbs, and a 12-word adverb. Since these are random for each playthrough, randomly picking one word in each pod won't work. The adverbs also appear randomly, and you can't guess a pickup line before it's said. So just wait (Z), then go for the seven- or eight-letter words.

You only need three of the seven words.

This twelve-letter adverb always works:
> DESPAIRINGLY

One of these two ten/eleven-letter adverbs will work:
> DESPERATELY
> EMOTIONALLY
> DRAWLINGLY

Here are the nine-word adverbs:
> MARTIALLY
> SINCERELY
> SOBBINGLY
> TEDIOUSLY
> WEARINGLY

Here are the unique-letter eight-word adverbs (also called isograms. Knowledge!) :
> MODESTLY
> STEAMILY
> STUPIDLY

Here are the duplicate-letter eight-word adverbs:

> BLEARILY
> COITALLY
> FORMALLY
> RIBALDLY
> SHABBILY
> SHODDILY
> SILENTLY
> SUDDENLY

Here are the unique-letter seven-word adverbs:
> SAINTLY
> SHADILY
> SNIDELY
> STARKLY

Here are the duplicate-letter seven-word adverbs:
> BOSSILY
> SEEDILY
> TACITLY
> TEARILY/IRATELY (you can use either one--note no letters are duplicated, but there are two solutions, so it got bumped to the "easy" pool)

Now we're going to skip the conversation, here, but you may wish to work through it. Gretta describes what sort of allies work best against Elvira and why.

The sea cube and the eels--but you only have weak words. Fortunately, the medals you have make them trust you.

The vow here is a last lousy point.

Now you can get rid of the moat.

The next part with Mr. Lee is an alternate solution, if you went south first. It's also a way to get full points. Longer words, though.

(XTR) > N

The "vow here" is an LLP. But back to the main line...

> N

The imp needs to be provoked. There are three ways, based on its description. You only need two, and they're all functinally equivalent. Again, let's save a couple keystrokes by using the shortest ways through. It's actually a bit tougher than its colleagues to the south.

> BRUTELY
> REMOTELY

(ALT) > ENRAGEDLY

> N

The owls plan to kill you with speed!

> SLOW

The other animals follow this, uh, mechanic. You only need three of them, and it doesn't matter whom you leave, but why not get all four?

Leopard, Ocelots, Satyr, Badger.

> GARBED

> COOLEST

> ARTSY

You don't need to change the fourth animal, but why not.

(XTR) > PAROLED

You may notice one of your medals has changed now.

> S

You need to get by the shrewin' whiners. Three ways to do that. They have jollity, callosity, and tallyhoing. But, as above, any of the three pairs is equally good.

> JOLTILY
> STOICALLY

(ALT) > LOATHINGLY

> S

You need to fix that raptor.

> PARROT

Nails, thrones, pines, corona. Again, you actually only need three of these, and it doesn't matter which gets left, but I hope they are not too hard.

> SNAIL

> SNIPE

> RACOON

(Two c's works, too.)

You don't need to change the fourth non-animal, but why not.

(XTR) > HORNETS

You may notice the other of your medals changing as you summon these animals.

You have enough allies now. Time to kill the hardy hydra.

> N

> N

> W

> W

> W

You can get two LLPs noting Elmer and Merle are ideas aides, then taking care of the holy nest behind them.

But hmm, what could beat a hydra? Something you already saw! Something like...what the parrot was!

> RAPTOR

Hmm, the whistle is interesting. Sounds like it yelped.

> DEEPLY

You may need to use those medals before visiting Elvira. Hm, IQ + Lucky = ...

> QUICKLY

> W

The repartee is just there for your amusement. Now, Elvira won't kill you ASAP, since you deflected her atack. Unless you wait helplessly, and she regains confidence. You just need to make sure you have enough backup. If you didn't fix the whistle, you can retreat and do so.

> 7

> PLAY WHISTLE

And you have rescued Yorpwald from Elvira! I hope you enjoyed this. Maybe even...enough to play the epilogue.













































STORE H

This is a sort of catch-all area that I hope is still entertaining. Some of the puzzles are a bit obscure, but they're intended to be, since you only need to "get" 20 basic ones, and you can probably guess the category. I left out the tougher ones for expedience.

You can actually win Store H/Others without visiting the Clangier Clearing, if you plan right, but I figure I'd give the whole panoramic view.

If you've already completed the game, you can

> ROVE OVER

> OTHERS

> X STAND
> PEARS
> PLUMS
> GRAPES
> BLUEBERRIES

Hmm! What to do with a moss cap?

> COMPASS

Some goofy puzzles here. You probably figured the general theme.

> APPLES
> APRICOT
> GOOSEBERRY
> COCONUTS

> S

Yay, a tekno-token for money.

> LIMES
> POMEGRANATE
> CANTALOUPE

And now a coin! It can be changed now or later.

> N

> E

You can do a lot of things here in the Clangier Clearing.

> SOLEMN

> ANCIENTER

> W

You could return for another coin, but let's get all Curtis has to offer and also explore the rest of this area.

> W

> PINEAPPLE
> STRAWBERRIES
> BLACKBERRIES
> RASPBERRY

There's a lot more to do here and elsewhere, and you can probably guess a lot of the other fruits, but you have the minimum you need, now.

> E
> S

 Ooh, stuff from Curtis. Let's deal with the coins, because you don't need money with your tekno-token and droll dollar. They're almost artsy. Musical. Like some sort of drawing.

> SONIC
> ICONS

(Note: this should be doable in any order, e.g. coin->icon first and so forth. Or even SONIC ICONS and SONIC COINS.)

> N
> D
> GIVE DOLLAR TO TRADER

That gives you the "useless" so-great storage.

> PUT ICONS IN SLOT

Woohoo! A popstar's passport! Maybe it can get you through the gate!

> U
> N
> N

 Hmm, the passport is not enough on its own. Maybe you need to use it, or parts of it. Like the viewer and the searcher. They are not hard to use! Probably a lot easier to tinker with than other things in this game.

> REVIEW
> RESEARCH

(You can also note you get called a perp if you go north. That gives a third verb you should have no problem guessing. But you only need two, and, in fact, that's what the game will let you have. Note none of these are meant to be too hard, since you're really just putting ER at the end to RE at the start.)

(ALT) > N
(ALT) > PERP

 Hooray! The final FINAL ending!

OR IS IT? Well, there is still Demo Dome Mode, which isn't an adventure but more a museum-style thing to examine stuff. You won't need a walkthrough for that.











































There is not much to do in the DEMO DOME MODE other than to examine everything. The game keeps track of how much you have left to examine in any one room and nags you if you leave before examining everything fully.

Known Comp vs Post-comp walkthrough differences (this is largely for puzzles and does not cover changing location names.)

General: Trizbort map included with release 3. Last Lousy Points at very end, in ROT13.

1 ORDEAL RELOAD:
  * release 2: the chimney is now available for escape. Gunter's options are different. Elmo's are too. Elmo is moved, as are the plaster and plates. Elmo has a tutorial.
  * release 3: Gunter does not stop by until you examine a few things. So you have more time to activate the two new areas, and you also can figure what you're supposed to be doing. Plus you are forced to talk to Gunter for an overview, but you can skip the rest. You can also freely flip diorama things but nothing else, but flipping something that should create an exit brings Gunter closer. Elmo's tutorial is tuned up.
  * release 4: INTRO/MANOR is now ORDEAL RELOAD. New LLP in the Gallery with the ISBN bins. New tutorial LLP with the Respect Specter.
2 TROVES:
 * release 2: you now have a new possible action at the end in addition to dealing with the singer. Eddie C was not in release 1. The lager was also moved from the Very Top/Office. DIVORCES did not appear in release 1.
 * release 3: you had only one way to find the cellar (the direct way) in release 2. Now you have another. LLP with the book the guy gives you at the start. It's renamed, with an author, Peg A. Page. There's now a different puzzle to enter the skyscraper (PERNOD vs WEST)
 * release 4: the verbose babblings became a sob ever verbose, to make it clearer what to do. Two rooms were added. The Drain Nadir is an offshoot of Boredom Bedroom. The Roadbed and Sublet forked from the second room that kept changing its name. The skyscraper is now the godlings' lodgings. The END PRONER POD replaces the Pernod. The Upscale Capsule is rearranged so the red vees are the first puzzle (IGNORE REGION became a general jump command) with Sister Tressi and Blamer Balmer at the end. The final puzzle, the Trance Nectar, is new, and Eddie C's song is sent to the Drain Nadir.
3 ROUTES:
  * release 4: optional ways through various areas are now disabled. The end puzzle is now in an area past the Cripple Clipper. The two mutually exclusive former winning words are now both necessary, and there is an additional command, too. ABOARD is no longer a solution. The raptest patters are a new LLP.
4 PRESTO:
 * release 1 (deprecated) : Rickey is in Dirge Ridge instead of Rand.
 * release 2: Lawl Wall replaces Horned Hedron (moved to Oyster) with more sensible puzzle. You now need to summon a SUB or BUS at the end. Rand was Rickey. The Lawl Wall was not there. Many places are renamed.
 * release 3: some causality is fixed in this release. It may have more to do with the hints than the actual puzzles, but that should be clearer, now. The escaroles allow an alternative path to bring the yak over. You no longer have to read the textbook.
 * release 4: the HAWT THAW is now an LLP. The Volt Maze/Nowt Town now has two different ways to win, with the longer word getting more points. There are also three new last lousy points: one in the seminar and two in the shack.
5 OYSTER:
  * release 1 (deprecated) : you DESTROY Oyster D at the end and can pull the lever if you want. No yapper.
  * release 2: you can now do something with the sign in the initial area, and there's a new verb for you to get out, which relies on people there and not the bar name. Also, you need to get 3 of 5 verbs. The sign in the shore is gone, but the raft is visible and has a two-part solution with oars. You no longer need to ARRIVE--there's a better verb since there are boats. The portal moved from the plains to the hideout. You no longer need to SHAPE the heaps--the tubs, instead. The papery yapper is not present to bribe. The pills are now available to skip a puzzle. There is a side area to put an item to frame the walleyes less implausibly. There is also a side quest that starts in the Fishbowl and ends just before the final location, which is named differently. It involves wipes, waste, a lance, an ant and, optionally, the heaps, re-purposed. You also get killed a lot less by the haunter. The game just gives warnings now.
  * release 3: it's now 3 of 6 verbs to learn in the Hops Shop (renamed in release 2) though 2 relate to the jukebox, along with an LLP in the Handsome Sand Home (ex-fishbowl) (dent) and in the plains (general) with a LLP in Lean Lane. You also have another puzzle and location if you get on the boats (LEAP).
  * release 4: you now don't use the lever at all. You replace the pins. You can SPIN or SNIP them. The rude door was replaced by span-pans, which you need to SNAP at to get past. The side quest also has a tricky LLP. Many locations are renamed. Also, the haunter is now a use-saga sausage.
6 TOWERS:
 * release 2: guardians are moved around, with the ingrates (more appropriate for the right word) replacing the yapper, who is optioned to the Oyster's final room where it makes more sense. The nebula now guards items in the topside. You must also get rid of both the prefect (swaps with pirates) and the deacons so the kid appears. The bonker is new as well. The sweatier wait-seer replaces the thug and clues the right word better. Many guardians are moved around. You could skip certain things with the kid before, like giving him the Gizmo, but you can't now.
 * release 3: the tavern was moved to the start, to give you a clearer idea what to do and give more of a storyline. You need to dispel three of six random guardians before Rodney goes, not 2 of 4, Daltho has his own room, and DYING is switched back from a solution to what it is. The nebula now guards Daltho's own room. You go back there instead of to the tavern. Andrew, Archie, Barney, Bredo, Dewey, Goldy, Marcel, Marlon (I didn't find the relatively simple code to override "normal,") Royce and Wade are also not present in the comp release. Most were in release 2 as well, though I'm too lazy to research which. RIP the slobb-blobs. The snider diners and natives are new, with greedy Ed Yerg replacing the greedy gnome. The atheists and yacker are new, too, with the serpent replacing the nebula. The yurts are now a last lousy point. Curst Palace now has a name--Castle Apcur.
 * release 4: the jetskis are gone, replaced by a bot boat, and you now ENTER BOAT to get where you need. The kid is also replaced by an Agnostic, whom you need to help to focus on what they always meant to do. The old puzzle (TENTATIVE) is now an LLP. The deacons are also replaced by a gender-specific guardian that clues the necessary letter collection better. The nameless salesmen were also moved to ambient scenery in the Clangier Clearing, in Others. The rewired robot is gone, replaced by the butlers, but it serves as an LLP elsewhere--sort of. Also, the stinger now defends the subsector after you've disposed of the bonker. The fluster-self rut is a new guardian, replacing the organised ego-drains, which are relegated to an LLP. The neural pulses are also replaced by the sporties' ripostes as an LLP. The keycar is relegated to LLP status, and the iPrune is renamed and moved to the end, replaced by the Resident Trendies. The Tetris Sitter replaces Ed Yerg, giving the puzzle a different flavor, since there are also three other LLPs to get a proper gift. Dreads Adders now block your way at the start. Sporties' ripostes are another LLP. Whew! Oh, added the Dourest Detours with an LLP and another LLP in the Loftier Trefoil.
7 OTTERS
 * release 2: cinders now give a LLP or a hint. Merle and Elmer now clue a different LLP and clue it a bit better. You can now talk to Elvira, which is more just repartee before the final fight, but it does mean one more move.
 * release 3: the whistle shouldn't sound like it yelped. I repositioned the moat so it offered an additional, though trivial, barrier. Damsel became Gretta, and she added a dialogue. There's now a moat, which shouldn't be hard to ditch. You need to say QUICKLY before entering the Reclusion Inclosure.
  * release 4: I added yet a few more ways the players were annoying, because it was fun for me. Added another LLP to irritate Elmer and Merle as well as a further one for clearing both north and south of the Downside. The Inclosure is now where Elmer and Merle are, and the Rancho is now the final room. Two ways to dispel the animal guardians were replaced with more thematic words and moved to the Downside.
8 OTHERS was an added area for release 2, so there are really no comparisons from release 1 to release 2. Other than that I hid it for release 1 a week before the deadline because I realized it wasn't a good introduction, and I wanted to put it somewhere, but I didn't know where.
 * release 3: added persimmon and breadfruit. I forget if Curtis gave you the token right away in release 2, or you had to wait.
 * release 4: added coconuts and other fruits. New puzzle for tangerine, and melons/lemon each have their own word now.
9 DEMO DOME was added in release 3, so there are no comparisons before.
 * release 3: initial, and you just examine stuff.
 * release 4: testing helped improve the dome.
















































METRICS

The game has point totals for each region, but how relatively difficult are the puzzles? I decided to take a look at how many letters you needed to type in for the various anagrams. I've tried my best to use a Python script to count the keystrokes and make sure no commands were missed. While there shouldn't be any errors, I hope the big picture observations would still stand, anyway. I also didn't account for using cheat mode to reduce the number of possibilities.

I think that this overview of complexity isn't fully accurate since the complexity of a puzzle likely varies more as (letters ^ 2) or even (log(total possibilities in non-cheat mode)) or something. But I don't want to throw too-big numbers at you. If you're very interested, a heat map should be attached with this release. METRICS.HTM is the file name, created by wmet.pl, for "write metrics."

Ordeal Reload has a minimum of 37 and a maximum of 78. Find the direct way to the gallery and ignore the giant pin, snib and respect specter for the minimum score. Incidentally, the direct way to the gallery makes the puzzles, on average, tougher. I think there is a very strong case for claiming a four-letter puzzle plus a five-letter puzzle is easier than an eight-letter puzzle. But in this case, I'm going strictly by linear numbers.

Stores has a minimum of 36 and a maximum of 67. It is 18 if you use the patcher. You have six stores to open. The Lectures quest gives 19, Store H gives 6, and Store B gives 6.

Store V has a minimum of 95 and a maximum of 142. The eight Last Lousy Points account for most of the difference, but the alternate stream/lobster and bee/arena puzzles provide the other two letters. The siters are technically slightly easier than the marble as well.

Store U has a minimum of 120 and a maximum of 134. The last lousy points give you seven letters each. It's debatable here whether U is harder than V. U clearly has fewer choices for words, and V may be a bit longer to clear completely, since the optional points can get skipped. But V is potentially quicker.

Store P has a minimum of 131 and a maximum of 198. You can gain or lose a letter with the right good-bye to Leo and Rand. The lamb, TBA, starch charts and ROM sticks go, too, along with drives A and E. You can save 4 letters in the maze. How you deal with Ye Hoop also means a shift of two letters. This has a moderate amount of points, but many solutions are relatively short. Again, the actual parts-of-speech make Store P's choice of words restricted--well, at least until the hacks' shack. But then the necessary things to change are often simple.

Store Y has a minimum of 130 and a maximum of 202. Many solutions are short words. The five-command side quest is a big one. You can spill the pills right away to "lose" 8 more letters.  You can add a few letters with the right actions in the Posh Hopa Shop and crossing the river via the boats and not the raft. Several LLPa raise the maximum above Store P.

Store W has a minimum of 157-161 and a maximum of 330-339, subjected to some randomness. Both the "H" and "I" paths through the guardians are 36 letters. The proof is a bit tricky, but you'll note that guardians with 6 letters guard squares 1N and 1E of Scope Copse. Guardians with 7 letters guard squares 2 away from Scope Copse, and guardians with 8 letters guard squares 3 away. You must pass one guardian with 8 letters, clearly, but trying to avoid passing two (except for the hostile/atheists) means you have to pass six. The basic idea below is that, if you only defeated one eight-letter guardian, you would need to defeat four guardians to link up the six rooms in the southwest diagonal, but that's impossible, since each guardian would only open up one new room as you went through.

You can save keystrokes with other alternate puzzles, too. Fussier vs. unlocked. The tavern may take an extra keystroke or two based on randomness since one group of enemies has 4 or 5 letters, and another has 7 or 8. That is why the totals are not exact: the prosaic picaros are randomly determined at the start of the game, so you can't undo to get easier ones. You can skip too much to list here. But even at a minimum, W has you solve more letters than some store maximums. Combined with a big map, you can see why this is the toughest region.

Store T has a minimum of 146 and a maximum of 212. The bran barn forces you to use one more letter, and you can LLP Elmer and Merle twice, pick off the vow here and final animal in the preserve and realm, and get rid of the cinders. Also, you can pick the long options for the shrewin' whiners (19) vs the minimum (16) or decide whether to pick the long option for the imp (16). The players also can swing from 22 to 31. Since the players' tries are divided into pods, there are many tries to choose from, but the overall length is relatively non-variable. One pod has words with length 10 or 11, but that is it. Also, this range is not fully representative of the difficulty compared to other regions, since you can deduct a lot of points for when letters end in LY. That drops it to 124 to 188. (Only one of the LLPs ends in LY.)

Store H has a minimum of 160 and a maximum of 321. But its theme is easy enough, I think, that it shouldn't be too tough, even though it seems long. The last two puzzles are intentionally silly.

LAST LOUSY POINTS

Note that I'm not really going to address cases like finding 3/3 things when you only need 2/3 or, in OTHERS, where you can avoid flipping a lot of fruits. Or all the guardians in Towers, where you can leave three of the seven picaros in the Trefoil alone. Those should be in the walkthrough, because they can all potentially help you solve the game. These are stand-alone points which are utterly unnecessary to solving things and, in fact, don't progress the story, but I hope they provide interesting detail. Often they will seem superfluous or even slightly hidden, or the word to solve them may be obscure. (That's why they're not in the main walkthrough.)

Hints are in ROT13. If you aren't sure what ROT13 is, it means moving a letter 13 forward or back in the alphabet. If you don't want to do the translation in your head, and I don't blame you, it can be translated at ROT13.com. I take no responsibility for your being able to figure ROT13 and thus have answers spoiled if you get too good at reading ROT13 clues. If that happens, take time to feel smart. You deserve to.

ORDEAL RELOAD:

FAVO for the ISBN bins.

The Respect Specter will give up a FPRCGRE.

STORES:

FBEORG from Store B. This is also in Shuffling around. Note that the side trip to Cruelest Lectures means 3 extra points, and doing so gives you a hint item.

PRESTO:

OYNZ scares the lamb in the Grey Gyre. But only enough to send it safely home!

You can say TBBQARFF to the sods gone odes song.

You can say CEBFG to the sport ports.

JUNG gets rid of the hawt thaw in Phat Path. (Neat ROT13, eh?)

The starch charts in Phat Path can be labeled GENFPU.

The TBA key can become GNO.

The escaroles can become a PNFFREBYR.

The trim socks become EBZ FGVPXF--with or without the space. The last letter is optional, too. The escaroles become PNFFREBYR. This allows an alternate way through.

Drive A and Drive E can also be enhanced. Drive A becomes NIVQRE, while you can QREVIR ways to improve Drive E.

ROUTES:

Go GBJNEQF the worst ad before leaving the Same Mesa.

You can also be JVGUBHG the raptest patters any time in the Sonancy Canyons.

TROVES:

TNCR at Simple Impels by Peg A. Page.

FGNL around A Sty.

TYNER at the lager (again, interesting ROT13.)

QVFPBIRE something about Divorces magazine. There actually is a magazine named this LLP, and it's pretty well-known. Or it was. It's much less fluffy than Divorces.

Note that troves has a few 1-of-2 puzzles, where you may or may not skip to the next area after getting one of them, and you may or may not be able to solve both. For instance, Sister Tressi and the Marble Blamer. These are listed in the walkthrough.

Which are they? The live bee/senora, lobster/stream, blamer/sister, and praise spirea/rivets.

TOWERS:

Note that five of the guardians can be left alone. They aren't covered below. Similarly, three of the prosaic picaros can be left alone.

In the Loftier Trefoil:
The recital article can become GNYPVRE.

In the Scope Copse:
The Try Us Yurts can be LHEGF.

In the Baldest Blasted Saltbed:
The docile old ice can be PBVYRQ.

In the Leveraged Everglade:
TENAQVBFR for the organised ego drains.

Before visiting either of the Lost Lots or Fringe Finger when both are unvisited, you are sent to the Dourest Detours.
EBHFGRQ helps you get refocused and returns you where you meant to go.

In the Lost Lots:
CEBFVRFG for the sporties' ripostes.

In the Fringe Finger:
The strudel can be EHFGYRQ for an extra point, though you can just take it.

In the Treading Gradient:
The mended mini denim can be ZVARQ for a new pastry.
The replay player can become CRNEYL.

Once you've cleared everything in one of the main square, a keycar appears. It can become PERNXL.

The Coasting Agnostic can also be made NGGRAGVIR in the Subsector.

You can even fix the boat a bit more in Actionless Coastlines. The weirder red wire can be ERJVERQ.

Across Leak Lake, there is the quest for the top opt pot. The pester'n serpent can become CERFRAG, the unripe ur-pine can become CHAVRE, the Nastier Stainer etinas can become NAGFVRE, and the Tetris Sitter can become GEVFGR. Give the top opt pot for a non-anagram point.

You also get a final last lousy point for ABG HFVAT K-ENL IVFVBA. VS LBH NGR N CNFGEL LBH PNA FGVYY TRG GUVF CBVAG.

OYSTER:

FPNA the cans in Hardest Trashed Dearths. Once you leave to Lean Lane, this LLP will not be available.

GRAQ the dent in Lean Lane.

FCYNVA in the Lapsin' Plains.

Side quest:
* FJVCR wipes in Lean Lane.
* FJRNG (over the waste) in Shuttle Hutlets.
* FUNCR heaps (not necessary for the quest but not available without it) in Shuttle Hutlets.
* PYRNA the lance.
* GENZCYR (ooh, another cool ROT13) the templar ramplet (you need the restored lance to do this.)
* CFNYZ by the Plasm Lamps.
* GNA ant. (Once in Plasm Lamps, this isn't optional. It's the only way to get out.)

Finally, ERIRY by the lever in the Den Loft.

OTTERS:

As in Troves and Towers, multiple passages through mean that solving one way makes other puzzles LLPs. There are two ways to get your powers back, which get two points, and you have an extra animal in Lamer Realm and Perverse Preserve. That makes four of the seven LLPs.

You can ERFPVAQ the cinders instead of using them for a clue with DISCERN.

There are also two ways to annoy Elmer and Merle.
Elmer and Merle are also ideas aides and can thus be (temporarily) NFVQR. This gives another LLP.
After the holy nest appears, UBARFGYL is in tune with the area's earlier theme, an -LY adverb.

OTHERS:

Resisting the temptation to use the arugula to "guru" any item successfully nets a bonus point once you solve this area.
