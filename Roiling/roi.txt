>General
?Does the male/female option have any practical difference?
Well, one. It changes two guardians behind Store W. It also changes the names/genders of some people you'll meet or hear of.
Spoilers ahead, but not really.
Dr. Yow's gender is the same as yours.
So is Pat's.
The tarred trader is Red Rat Art Erd or Dr. Tera Darter.
The Coasting Agnostic is Scot Agin or Staci Ong.
The person on A Droll Dollar is Lord Al Ollard or Dr. Lola Ollard.
The south exit from the Coastlines, in Store W, features either Lois the Hostile or the Hostile-Is-He Lot.
The Deal Seer west of the Strait is Lars Eede or Elsa Erde.
There may be an embarrassing bug where a female NPC is referred to as male, but I hope not. I searched pretty thoroughly, I guess/think. If you find one, I'll fix it and give you credit.
Also, if any animals are referred to as male, let me know, as that's a potential bug. I tried to leave them gender-neutral.
?Hey! Why do location names change? Does this mean anything?
There's no deeper meaning, though it means you're probably mostly done with the area.
Also, I had some really cool anagrams I wanted to share and bring to the front, and when they fit, I added them. I hope you enjoy the changes of scenery.
?Why can't I play with a lot of the scenery? How can I tell if it's useful?
One, you can try scanning stuff.
Two, if something is described as blocking most ways out, it is probably just there for ambience.
You can also try a cheap anagram of one of the words.
>ORDEAL RELOAD
>>DUSTY STUDY
?What do I do here?
Just examine stuff to get an idea of what the game is about.
And what your powers are.
The item names should be a clue.
A rich chair, pedanto-notepad, the sad ads.
You may note the book titles as well.
The diorama probably clinches it.
You need to find three pieces of evidence that tell you about your power to further the story.
You can look at the bookshelf, take the notepad, consult the notepad, try to "flip" something successfully, examine the diorama, or flip something in the diorama.
You can also THINK, which acts as two pieces of evidence.
You may also notice something curious about the location names, if you looked ahead in this document.
You probably figured it out by now, but your power is to turn things into anagrams of themselves.
?Short answer: what is my power, anyway?
You have the ability to anagram things magically.
?What is the knock at the door?
Someone to see you. You can find out if you open it, or you can wait a few turns.
?What should I talk to Report Porter Perrot about?
The first discussion is the main one. Everything after that is babble.
You'll discover the latches after you wake up if you didn't already.
?It's dark! Where can I get light?
The palm soaked up light during the day.
Wait and stumble around a bit.
The game gives hints, often misspelled, which clue your special power.
Do you notice P-A-L-M or some permutation in each clue?
What is one that would give light?
<b>LAMP</b>.
You will take it automatically.
?What's the pedanto-notepad good for?
You will track hints and procedural stuff as the game goes by. It'll even remind you of stuff you couldn't yet flip.
?What is the op-ed good for?
A better question is, what isn't it terrible for?
It's a bit longer than most op-eds.
It's pretty much propaganda, by Elvira, for Elvira.
Hopefully it is good for a few laughs.
?What are the latches for?
The list that comes with them is a clue.
Do you notice how the words are similar?
Adjacent words have their first and last letters flipped.
So, latches can become...
<b>SATCHEL</b>.
?What does seeing red mean?
It means that all the letters in the current object or its description are wrong compared to what they should be.
?How do I get out of here?
The tables and the ten beams hide ways out. So is "my niche" on the ceiling.
What are other rooms in a mansion? And what is something that leads up
The TABLES become a <b>STABLE</b> you can enter, but it's intermediary...
...and so is the <b>CHIMNEY</b>...
...because you can just bypass them and go directly to the <b>BASEMENT</b>, which is a longer/harder puzzle to find.
?What is the giant pin for?
It's an optional last lousy point.
If you use the settler on it, in cheat mode, it may be obvious what it is.
Last hint before a spoiler: it can become something more usually on a wall, and that gives hints of how to get other places.
The pin can become a <b>PAINTING</b>.
?How do I neutralize the oafs?
There are only twenty-three possibilities.
In fact, with the settler on cheat mode, there is only one. Without it, there are four.
But wait! Your dusty study doesn't need a sofa...
...which is okay since there are no oafs, anyway. However, if you wish to play a game with oafs in it, my IFComp 2014 game Ugly Oafs has lots of them!
?What do I do with the diorama?
There are four pairs to change back and forth. You don't get any points for it.
It familiarizes you with anagramming, the settler in general, and the possibilities of spaces.
<b>BRASS CRAG</b> and <b>CRABGRASS</b>.
<b>EVENT MAP</b> and <b>PAVEMENT</b>.
<b>FARM PLOT</b> and <b>PLATFORM</b>.
<b>STEEL PAD</b> and <b>PEDESTAL</b>.
>>FARMING FRAMING
?What's the sitar for?
It could be sitars...
Or rather <b>STAIR</b> or stairs.
?Can I build the stable/framing back up again?
No.
>>HIGHEST HEIGHTS
?What is this pram doing?
It gives you a slow sinking feeling.
What else is slowly sinking with the letters P-R-A-M?
And, if you examine it, has nothing in common with Mr. Pa?
The pram can become a <b>RAMP</b>.
?How do I use the closest closets?
Enter them to go back to the study. You'll see them everywhere in your manor once you know where to look.
Or if in you're the study, you go to the heights.
>>LARGELY ALL-GREY GALLERY
?Hey! Why isn't this a basement?
Well, "basement" was just a puzzle. I wanted to make all my location titles anagram-y. This was floating around, and I didn't know where to put it.
?Stria?!
Above you...an odd word, but another way to walk around.
<b>STAIR</b>.
?What are the ISBN bins for?
Well, you can ignore them and still win. They don't add anything.
Except a last lousy point for an odd word.
They're unlocked, but you can change that.
Make a <b>SNIB</b>.
?Anything remaining to do in the largely all-grey gallery?
Figure how the letters settler works, though you don't have to, as you'll get a tutorial.
Then go IN.
?Help! There's a guy with a gun!
Well, it's not just any gun. It's a RIFLE.
You won't make it to the rifle in time, and he doesn't seem too enthusiastic to shoot it, so maybe you can use some magic?
The name is in red, which may help eliminate possibilities.
The rifle with the bullet with your name on it...
...can become a <b>FLIER</b> with your name on it.
Now that you've shown your powers, your former (apparent) antagonist will be more friendly to you.
?What can Elmo tell me? Do I need to listen?
You can solve the game without Elmo, but he can tell you how to use the settler if you're not sure. It's a de facto tutorial about the settler
You can also ask Elmo about the areas ahead.
>>CARVEN CAVERN
?Why is the Respect Specter here? Is it useful?
You can complete the game without figuring what it has for you.
You can immediately figure what it has for you and be none the wiser about why it is there.
The Respect Specter is there to help you understand ambiguous readings on the settler in cheat mode.
It throws up six of seven in cheat mode.
The specter will help you decipher what this means without too many complications.
In this case, almost all letter entries are ambiguous, because they match up with RESPECT or SPECTER.
You can scan the specter a lot to figure things out.
And whenever you want, you can get the <b>SCEPTER</b> for the bonus point.
?What's with the plates?
They appear to be embedded in the plaster.
They are sort of square, with metal trim around them.
What is metal and looks like half a square?
<b>STAPLE</b>.
?What's with the plaster?
You need to get rid of it, somehow.
If you did something with the plates, it'll be a bit easier to know what to do with the plaster.
The settler gives you three letters.
What does a staple (plates) go in?
The plaster becomes a <b>STAPLER</b>.
?Stupid act-ruin curtain! How can I get rid of it?
Well, it looks like lined paper, with the holes and the lines.
You can hook it back through the holes in the upper left.
PUT STAPLE IN STAPLER.
Then STAPLE CURTAIN.
>The Settler
##roomlevel=3
>>Basic Use
?Can anyone in-game help me?
Yes. If you leave the basement, you get a de facto tutorial.
?What are the different colors on the settler for?
We'll assume you're not in cheat/teach mode now.
If you examine the settler, the graphic shows different colors.
More fourth-wallishly, you can see the game's title.
Look at items on the diorama.
What sort of letters do reds go to? What sort of letters do yellows go to?
Reds go to consonants. Yellows go to vowels.
?What's the diorama good for?
It can't be changed, but its components can.
The pedestal/steel pad and brass crag/crabgrass give good clues.
?What is cheat mode good for?
Reds may become purples. Yellows may become greens. But it's a bit rare.
What makes a color add blue to it?
Try scanning the brass crag and crabgrass.
bRAss crag, cRAbgrass change colors.
Those two letters are already in the right place.
So purple = consonant in the right place and green = vowel in the right place.
This is obviously very powerful with relatively few vowels/consonants. The right guesswork can logically eliminate a lot.
?I found an orange/brown letter!
If you know what red/yellow are, maybe you can reason what orange could be.
Or you could note a special unusual letter in that word.
Also, orange = red + yellow.
What letter may be a consonant or a vowel?
The letter Y.
So orange/brown is a bit of a gimme. Though it is rare.
?What are the question marks/ambiguous readings in cheat mode? Isn't cheat mode supposed to give MORE hints?
They actually can reaally help. What this means is that if something is made up of two words that anagram, at least one pre-anagram word's letter slot is right, and at least  one is wrong.
Let's take the LLP of Leis Isle from Shuffling Around as an example. It shouldn't be too much of a spoiler.
The Leis Isle would giuve ?YR?. That doesn't look very promising, but the vowel in slot 2 can't be an E, and the vowel in slot 3 can't be I.
Now slot 1 must be I or L, and slot 4 must be E or S.
But we've already used both I or E, so that leaves L in slot 1 and S in slot 4. LIES.
The ambiguous readings can thus be particularly nice for longer words, because there are only two possibilities. And if there is only one question mark, you know whether that letter is a vowel or a consonant, since the final word has the same number of consonants as either original.
?What's the slider for?
If you switch it, you'll see red when you totally guess wrong.
You only get a limited number here, but not seeing red is a sort of clue, too.
?What's the Equals Sign for?
If cheat mode is on, it warns you if the clue might make things too easy.
In fact, for certain puzzles, it warns you even if cheat mode is off.
That's a clue in itself, perhaps.
My evaluations of what makes a puzzle too easy are a bit subjective. However, I wanted to mitigate total spoilers, or give the player a chance to pause and think on the easy ones, so I added this.
##roomlevel=2
>STORES
>>STRIP OF PROFITS
?Which stores are useful?
The megaton magneto-montage acts as a directory.
K and N are optional. P, U, V, T, W and Y are useful.
?What is the approximate order of difficulty?
Of the stores you can enter right away, U is easiest, then V, then P, then Y, then W.
Y's individual puzzles may be the easiest, but it's got quite a few.
T is not so tough, due to its theme, but it's last. H is hopefully cake once you've got T. H has its own theme, which will be kind of obvious.
?What does store H become?
You can't do anything with it until after you solved the game.
The "extra good ending" is behind it, but the hoster won't let you in.
You may've guessed it was <b>OTHERS</b>.
?What does store P become?
Well, it becomes a sort of vortex, but you need a magic word, according to the poster.
Store P, Poster...
P-E--O with the settler on cheat mode. And you can eliminate others to get...
...<b>PRESTO</b>!
?What does store T become?
Some kind of water animal.
<b>OTTERS</b>.
?Why can't I enter store T right away?
It's the final scenario, where Elvira waits.
Well, one store has to be.
?What does store U become?
The settler, with cheat mode on, solves the vowels.
Roads, but with signs.
<b>ROUTES</b>.
?What does store V become?
The settler, with cheat mode on, solves the vowels.
Something valuable and glittering.
<b>TROVES</b>.
?What does store W become?
The settler, with cheat mode on, isn't much help.
If you look at it right, it seems taller than the others. It's not just an optical illusion.
It also seems to split in two.
What's tall and plural?
<b>TOWERS</b>.
?What does store Y become?
The settler, with cheat mode on, solves the vowels. And the letter Y.
It's something seawatery.
<b>OYSTER</b>.
>>>STORES K AND N
?Why are K and N smaller than the others?
They're a totally optional subquest.
?What's store K?
This is a bit of slang. I let it go for a reason. Suspicious smelling smoke.
KT Rose is a clue and it should be enough, abstractly...
...to get <b>TOKERS</b>.
?What's store N?
You need to figure the guy's name.
Again the settler logics this one, but clues like underwater and Tintin may help.
<b>NESTOR</b>.
?What's the mangiest steaming? What's in it?
The steaming is a byproduct of the tokers' activities.
Inside the steaming is the start of a small unnecessary side quest. Enter it to find out.
>>CRUELEST LECTURES
?Can I take advantage of the teasing seating?
No. But you don't need to.
It is TEASING seating, after all.
?What's the pamphlet good for?
Well, it has a clue.
I USED TO jibes with other things the blabber babbler says.
?What's with the tedious lecture and studio E and "I used to?"
They're clues to how to disrupt this whole joint. Ha ha. Joint, geddit?
This is a wild card word.
Your settler gives a huge clue if you look in studio E.
<b>OUTSIDE</b>.
?What's with the munchies now I'm back in the strip?
They aren't an actual game item, but they will help you use the slider on the settler more often.
?What's in Store B?
Some sort of food. It looks sort of misty--cold misty.
<b>SORBET</b>.
>STORE P
>>GREY GYRE
?What do I do here?
Look around. There are quite a few exclamations.
Many of the things you need to get are relatively short words, so maybe you can figure it out by accident.
Interjections are what work here.
?Poor lamb! What can I do?
Maybe you can scare him off without being mean.
Turning him into balm won't give him balm.
You _can_, however, make a scary noise.
<b>BLAM</b>.
?How to get over the hump?
You're grunting wrong.
<b>UMPH</b>.
?Do I have to tackle that maze to the north?
You don't even have to set foot in it, if you figure the right word. It's a tricky one, but there are a lot of clues. You may even wish to eat the crust once you've cleared everything else.
See the Volt Maze section below.
?The plebe won't let me by!
Just saying a word isn't enough, but it gets you started.
It's a generic word.
<b>BLEEP</b>.
You don't have the authority.
Once you get the star from Char Arch, you will.
?The maze is gone now. Why can't I go north?
The ether hides enemies. If only you could point them out...
...saying <b>THERE</b>.
That doesn't quite work, though, without ammunition.
Don't continue until you've fixed the popgun.
Also, did you find the dart?
PUT DART IN POPGUN.
>>AUSTERER TREASURE
?How do I reach YE HOOP?
If you try to take it, your possessions weigh you down. You can't find the right way to ditch your possessions for a second.
Say <b>POOH</b>...
...or, to really do the job, say <b>PHOOEY</b>.
?What can the N-E-Recs censer be?
Recs and Rec are too short to make a word.
The green semi-text on black may be a clue.
The censer becomes a <b>SCREEN</b>.
>>CHAR ARCH
?What's in the cretins' cistern?
A dart. It's frustrating to get. You'll probably get it as soon as you give up.
Or say <b>DRAT</b>.
?How do I get the star?
Again, you'll probably get it as soon as you give up. But you can't just give up on purpose. You must be legitimately frustrated.
Say <b>RATS</b>.
?Can I budge the yak? Or the yoke?
Not til you've been in the shack. The yoke and yak are no joke. Jack.
You need to gain the yak's trust. It looks herbivorous.
Seen anything eatable and plant-y?
The flea, when changed to a leaf, is edible. Well, for a yak.
But you don't just want to give the leaf to the yak.
If you've got the skid, you can put the leaf on the skid, then push the skid south to the Char Arch. The yak will walk on it.
?The yak's movable now, but how to get rid of the yoke?
The yoke has a safety, so if it's jarred, it'll snap.
There are three ways to do things.
First, you can just push the skid back north. The narrow/magnetic entry will unlock the yoke.
Second, if you flipped the escaroles, they become good food for Leo and Rand. You can go south and give them a workout!
Third, you can take the bad book from the shack and give it to the yak, who gets indigestion.
You may or may not know what to do with the drab yoke. The exciting conclusion is in the Shack section.
>>MARINES SEMINAR REMAINS
?What do I do with the pop-gun?
It's PG-on-up, but twiddling that does nothing.
The boing-go bin could use a moment of discovery.
So say <b>BINGO</b> to get it working.
?Are the Sport Ports important?
To get all the points in the area, yes.
To complete the game, no.
This is a slightly obscure word, but it is a toast in German.
The settler's clue (plus STROP giving red) may tell what it is.
<b>PROST</b>.
>>DIRGE RIDGE
?Who's this Leo and how can I avoid him?
He's too clumsy to get you, but maybe you can get him good.
He does bull at you.
<b>OLE</b>.
?Oh no! Rand joined in!
He doesn't look too smart, like he can be fooled by a feint.
If you say <b>DARN</b>, it will get him.
?Oh no! I hurt their feelings!
They do talk about how they're washups. Their dialogue also cues other words.
Say <b>WHASSUP</b> to get in their good graces.
?Are they going to follow me everywhere?
Well, until you get close to the end.
And not into the volt maze. You have to go there yourself.
?Can I do anything with the Sods-Gone Odes Song?
It's not critical, but a light interjection will help you deal.
Say <b>GOODNESS</b>.
>>NOWT TOWN (VOLT MAZE)
?Why can't I enter the maze yet?
You need to get a few points and figure out what's going on.
?Do I need to go through the volt maze? How many times?
No. You need to figure a word or phrase. There are two. The easy and hard way.
The maze entry zany meter should give some clues.
The zany-1 is the easiest, at four letters, but the harder one is eight.
?What's the easy way?
Nowt Town can be dispelled with a specific word.
It's not strictly a common interjection, but interjections are used to show intense emotion. Many interjections were once one word, or two words squashed together.
In this case, you don't want to go through the maze, and you're not going to.
<b>WONT</b>.
?What's the hard way?
This is a tricky one, but there are a lot of clues.
Touching the walls or reading E-Z Ol' Av will give a clue.
Scanning the fellows in the Unwary Runway helps, too. There are three. When you scan the first two with cheats on, a new one will appear next time through.
There should be some clues about Yiddish language or phrases.
You can say <b>MAZEL TOV</b> at any time. With or without spaces.
?Is there any advantage to the hard way?
You get an extra point, if you're interested in that sort of thing.
?I took the hard way but still lost a point from the maximum. What gives?
You scanned a fellow in the Unwary Runway for an additional clue.
>>UNWARY RUNWAY
?How do I get past the riddle dreidl?
You don't. You need a magic word.
?What are these guys doing?
They're clues, if you scan them.
>>SAPS' PASS
?How do I deal with the hogs?
You can annoy them or get their keys.
The hogs look up for heavy duty swears, and they'll probably be annoyed by mild expressions.
You can pretend you don't really want the keys by saying <b>SYKE</b>...
...or you can bug the hogs by saying <b>GOSH</b>.
Either way, the hogs get mad at you, tire themselves out chasing you, and leave the keys open for Rand and Leo.
>>PHAT PATH
?What are the harpings phrasings for?
They're in all caps, not letting you get in.
Well, Leo and Rand, especially.
You need to relieve them of their duties. They don't belong in the shack, but they have a hard time leaving. You all had fun together.
The three sentences anagram to clumps of letters.
You only need two of these three to move on.
<b>TOUGH</b>...
...<b>LATER</b>...
...<b>SO LONG</b>.
?Is the hawt thaw significant?
Not strictly. It's only necessary to get maximum points.
It's really weird, though. It barely makes any sense at all!
It's a last lousy point, based on a puzzle that really didn't work in the first version.
If you take a good hard look at it, you may want to say <b>WHAT</b>.
?Are the starch charts significant?
Not strictly. They're only necessary to get maximum points. They also signal a switch from interjections to something new for the final bit.
They can be labeled <b>TRASCH</b>.
>>HACKS' SHACK
?There's a lot to do here! What's my ultimate goal?
Write a computer program.
Note that you can change stuff to stuff since it is out of the scope of SHATTER-THREATS.
?What's the Clack-Ops Locs Pack for?
It's in UPPER CASE LETTERS ALL THE WAY. It makes typing quieter, though you're not sure how.
There are no actual sunglasses, nor locators.
It makes a <b>CAPS LOCK</b> key.
Once you have a keyboard, you can PUT CAPS LOCK IN KEYBOARD.
?The gum?
Aw, c'mon. If you got here, this is a gimme!
Ugg, umm...
It becomes a <b>MUG</b>.
?The flea?
Something else organic.
Make it a <b>LEAF</b>.
?The pile of coal?
A good source of energy. Dirty and short term, but hey.
More important it's coal than a pile...
...so it's <b>COLA</b>.
Once you've got the bottle of ALocalCo Cola, POUR COLA IN MUG for an endless supply.
?The disk?
Well, it has portability etc.
It can become a <b>SKID</b>...
...then you can flip back to a <b>DISK</b> later, once your work area is set.
You'll need to move the skid around, unsurprisingly. Use the PUSH command.
However, once you've gotten rid of the yak, you'll want to flip the skid back to the disk for good.
?The slab?
Not important by itself, but you can put computer components on it as you find them.
The screen and the keyboard, in particular.
?The fount?
It's dry but restful.
<b>FUTON</b>.
?The trim socks?
These aren't critical, but if you figure them, good job.
They help the computer run a bit faster.
<b>ROM STICKS</b>.
?The escaroles?
They are not critical to the game, though they provide a slightly easier alternate solution.
Make 'em into something more workmanlike, less froufrou. More nourishing.
<b>CASSEROLE</b>.
There is too much for you to eat. Maybe a friend or friends can.
?The I'm Le Cop polemic?
You can't do anything right away, but the signature is another clue.
Mel Copi will teach you how to build the code...
...or, well, <b>COMPILE</b>.
?The schematic catechism?
It's not useful til you need to program, then you'll use it automatically.
So, yeah, it's mostly for amusement.
?The horrible book? (Note: there are five possible titles)
It's an alternate solution.
It also clues that you need to make a KEYBOARD.
If you've got the yak on the skid...
...you can GIVE BOOK TO YAK, and the yak reacts with indigestion and runs away. Click ahead for all five book names.
<i>Day Broke</i> by Rob Adkey, <i>eBay Dork</i> by Kary Bode, <i>Bred Okay</i> by Bad Korey, <i>Dear Koby</i> by Yoda Berk, and <i>Yo, Be Dark</i> by Dr. Bo Kaye.
?How do I work Drive A?
Well, you can change it, but that's a last lousy point.
You really need to just connect a bunch of things to it.
You need the keyboard to work, first. Then it needs to go on the slab.
You also need to have put the screen on the slab.
Switch the skid back to the disk, too, and you're ready--but there's a stupid error.
The Be-Troo E-Robot can do something for you. But what?
Once the disk is in, and the keyboard's attached, <b>REBOOT</b> or PUSH REBOOT.
?How do I change Drive A to be more efficient?
A DRIVE, DRIVE A, VARIED.
It seems sluggish, almost unwilling.
<b>AVIDER</b>.
?How do I fix Drive E? Do I need to?
It's a Last Lousy Point.
You can reverse engineer things...
...or just <b>DERIVE</b>.
?How do I get a keyboard?
See the Char Arch section.
?Great. I have the drab yoke. What to do with it?
Its scratchings contain 26 letters, all the numbers and punctuation.
It can become a <b>KEYBOARD</b>.
?What do I do with (what the yoke became)?
PUT KEYBOARD ON SLAB.
You can try to run things now, but you run into a case sensitivity error.
PUT CAPS LOCK KEY IN KEYBOARD.
You still have more to do, but this is a start.
?Why am I trapped in here?
You're far enough along, you don't need to go outside to solve the Presto Area.
You may be cut off from getting maximum points (for instance, if you didn't help the lamb), but I wanted to ensure the player they were close to the end.
?What's the TBA key?
TBA is not just TBA.
It's a <b>TAB</b> key. It helps with programming and formatting, but it's not critical.
?Help! I can't work the polemic!
First, you need to COMPILE, but you're too tired to get it to work. You're annoyed by the Speel, slipping on peels.
The cola won't help. You need to crash.
Or <b>SLEEP</b>.
?I have an error message saying BUB DUDE EGG!
Of course. Code never works at first. Even simple code.
Random actions leave you saying "BUDGE! BUDGE!"
Now you're awake, you've got the energy to <b>DEBUG</b>.
?What do I need to do with the USB?
It'd be nice to have transport out. And you have two options! Lucky you.
There are only five possibilities. So you have a forty percent chance with a random first guess.
You have no particular reason to visit Boise State University, the Universal Bank of Switzerland or St. Bonaventure University. (Thanks, acronymfinder.com!)
You can take a <b>SUB</b> or <b>BUS</b> out for slightly different alternate endings.
>STORE U
>>SAME MESA
?Is the worst ad good for anything?
It's bad for society in every way. Err, I mean, it's a last lousy point.
You can pick it off as long as the giant or the bean aren't present. If you get it first, you get a clue to the area. You may not need the clue, but it's there.
RADWOST or WORST AD shuffled gives...
<b>TOWARDS</b>.
?How do I get into the church?
Going IN is not formal enough.
Read the scripture picturers.
DIE SIN.
You can switch them to make SIN DIE. Which helps, if you use the settler.
Going IN is simply not enough.
You need to go <b>INSIDE</b>.
?How do I get into the restaurant or the store?
Hmm, Pat's and Oscar's.
If you haven't scored a point yet, you might not know what to do with these.
If you have, you know this area relies on prepositions.
Pat's--you need to go <b>PAST</b>.
Oscar's--you need to go <b>ACROSS</b>.
?What is the ant-sag sit-a-nag for?
It's <i>a giant's</i>. It's for sitting.
The anagramming suggests you can lean <b>AGAINST</b> it.
But you need to have visited the cleric circle and seen the reagent list first.
?Gast is here. How do I deal?
Gast blocks trying anything else that moves the story forward.
You can't climb directly on the sit-a-nag, but you have a different way to listen to Gast.
Note the side art.
Get <b>ASTRIDE</b> it.
Once you do, you can't leave, but you don't have to.
Now you need to avoid the WOE BOW BELL.
You need to go <b>BELOW</b>.
Next, Gast pulls out a copy of Rude 'N Nuder.
You need to hide <b>UNDER</b>, and Gast will give up and leave it behind.
?I helped Brother Horbert and came back, but what is A Bev O' Be Ova'?
You need to look elsewhere than down.
Look <b>ABOVE</b>.
Okay, what's that MORF-FORM doing?
Changing all the time, threatening to arrive.
Get rid of the threat arriving.
Make it <b>FROM</b>, and it will come crashing down.
?What's with a drama armada?
They're all staring at the bean. What clue can it hide? Where?
You need a good first word to tell the crowd what to do.
THE BEAN holds something under it. Wait, we've done UNDER before.
Something BELOW it. Wait, that's been done too.
<b>BENEATH</b>.
>>CLERIC CIRCLE
?What is there to do here?
See on the wall--there's a list of three things you need for a magic potion.
You'll need to examine it, to see what to do.
Come back once you have all three items.
>>IDLE DELI
?What should I say to Pat?
Not much. Well, just one word. It's the seed pit that's important.
?What to do with the seed pit?
It's where PETS DIE.
Pat discourages you from entering the seed pit. IT'S DEEP.
What's a preposition that counters something that's been said?
<b>DESPITE</b>.
Now you have the stupor sprout--another third of the reagents Brother Horbert needs in the Cleric Circle.
>>ADOBE ABODE
?What should I say to Oscar?
Not much. It's the pipe soot that's important.
?What about a trashy ashtray?
It's holding pipe soot! But you can't just up and steal it.
It's on the other side of Oscar.
Position yourself <b>OPPOSITE</b>, and you can take it behind your back without him looking.
>>HARMS MARSH
?What do I do with the sheol-holes?
Not fall into them.
Directions don't help, so you need to be more circumspect.
?Help! The NULL-IT UNIT is making it dark!
You have no light, and your lamp was broken a long time ago.
The unit is keeping things dark, as they were.
You can say it was dark and <i>unlit</i>, before...
...I mean, <b>UNTIL</b>.
?Where do I go? How do I find a trail with the odd run-on aura?
Chop it up until you see the six lettes: ADNORU.
So you need to look <b>AROUND</b>, and you'll find an un-road.
?The All-Noon Gag still darkens things!
Remember, you were told you need to NAG OL' NO-LAG LOGAN. There's an UN-ROAD you need to use to get there.
You're on your way to finding him, now.
Just go <b>ALONG</b>.
>>RIPE PIER
?What's with the mist?
Well, it's also DA MIST, if you listen to Sad Tim. Some of his babbling leaves you red-eyed.
One is thinking of DA MIST helps you feel more familiar, and you can go...
<b>AMIDST</b>.
>>CRIPPLE CLIPPER
?How do I need to go?
Logan's poem will give you some clues.
It's a weird preposition, a nautical preposition.
THAT WAR, etc.
You need to go <b>ATHWART</b>.
>>SONANCY CANYONS
?How do I get past those two animals?
The order matters.
The bent ewe comes first.
Guard it from the hurt hog.
<b>BETWEEN</b>.
Then the hurt hog.
You can leave it now.
Go <b>THROUGH</b>.
?Should I enter the yob den?
No. It's a final last distraction. However, you can sort of do something with it. You need to, to win this scenario.
You want to go <b>BEYOND</b>.
?Are the raptest patters important?
If you want a full score, yes.
Actually, they're best ignored. Aggressively.
Or done <b>WITHOUT</b>.
>STORE V
>>LOATHER RATHOLE
?What do I do here, in general?
Peg A. Page's self-help book tells you IT IS A WAY TO THINK.
Standard actions don't work.
You need to think straight.
Spoiloplis is about passive verbs.
?How do I get a replacement for heat?
You were thrown out of Eh, At Heat.
Burning anger may be literal and figurative.
Or burning <b>HATE</b>.
?I'm not emotionally invested enough to visit the Race Acre!
All that hate drained you. You need a new approach.
You need to <b>CARE</b>.
The game then mentions that emotion alone won't do it. Time to get more analytical.
?What do I do with Pa, Egg, Pea?
You don't have to do anything.
It's by Peg A. Page. It's about Peg A. Page. It profited Peg A. Page when sold.
Okay, I think I beat this into the ground.
<b>GAPE</b> at it.
?What's the deal with the tears taser?
Showing it no fear gets a bonus point.
<b>STARE</b> at it.
>>BUSTLE SUBLET
?What's the stop post for?
It can't turn into POTS or TOPS. Or expand your OPTS.
It will help you <b>SPOT</b>. But you need to get rid of the sob ever verbose.
?What do I do to ignore/dispel the sob ever verbose?
You can listen to it for clues. Lots of reds.
<b>OBSERVE</b>.
?Is the mussier misuser important?
Not to get through, but they will give a point.
<b>SURMISE</b>.
>>BOARDED ROADBED
?A Sty, Tasty, Say. Is it worthwhile?
To get full points, yes. But it's optional.
Three y's in twelve letters. Arithmetic says you need a passive verb with four letters.
<b>STAY</b>.
?This stupid evil bee is so near!
There are two ways to look at it: as so near, or an evil bee. Let's go with the bee itself.
It's an evil bee. It feeds on your doubt.
<b>BELIEVE</b>.
?Should I do anything with the SNORE-SO ARENA?
You don't have to. But you'll get an extra point.
It is still SO NEAR. It is a senora. It has no ears.
<b>REASON</b> that it cannot possibly exist.
?Why does the bee turn from evil to vile to live?
Silly anagrams. Plus, you can see how much it resists you.
?Oh no! Can I do anything to find L'Clear Cellar?
You can't quite remember, but fortunately...
With some thinking, you can <b>RECALL</b>.
>>DRAIN NADIR
?A spider, Ires Pad, diapers...
You can scan them all. But you need to hit rock bottom.
You must give up, sort of, and not give up.
<b>DESPAIR</b>.
?I may or may not want to drink the lager!
Turns out you don't.
It is upsetting to find it there. Such productivity lost!
This is a last lousy point.
The settler's cheat mode breaks it open since it scans "REGAL LAGER" as red. That makes the first letter clear. Then four possibilities are left.
You can cut them down further reading the red text about Ergal Agler.
Or you can <b>GLARE</b> at it right away.
?What is this song trying to say to me?
You need to move on from your despair.
Eddie C, CDEDE ... I
<b>DECIDE</b>.
>>BOREDOM BEDROOM
?Why can't I eat the Bortles Lobster yet?
You need to feel you can, you deserve it.
The settler in cheat mode throws a bunch of questions, but actually, that means a lot of things you can clean up.
<b>BOLSTER</b>.
?Why don't I understand the motivational picture of the stream?
You aren't on top of things yet. The stream should refocus you...
...if you <b>MASTER</b> things.
?What are the pleaser leapers for?
They're an optional puzzle.
You must do something close to despair. It's something that can follow despair or cause it.
<b>RELAPSE</b>.
?How do I lead?
Some despair still lingers. Dale Elda and Leda Adle have advice on how to lead in their book.
You need to learn to <b>DEAL</b>.
Though, first, if you haven't dealt with the lobster or ME ARTS, you won't have the guts or endurance. Taking care of both only gets you closer to maximum points.
>>BROWSE BOWERS
?What does Si Reed have to offer?
The See Dir has a list of places to reside.
It should make you want to reside.
Want can become <b>DESIRE</b>.
?Is the rotunda important?
It is just scenery, to give the Browse Bowers a feeling of isolation.
The rotunda is a reference to the Browse Bowers' old name.
The Miser Emirs' Mires are the new scenery to stay.
?DIVORCES magazine. Is it useful?
It's worse than useless from society's perspective, but hey, it gets you a last lousy point.
You need to realize something...
...there's an actual magazine called the word you need...
...<b>DISCOVER</b> why the magazine is rubbish.
>>ECON-CONE
?Who is the statue? What should I do with him/it?
The statue is one of two things you need to figure out to move on to the next area, sort of like the Bortles Lobster and ME ARTS back in Boredom Bedroom.
Trevis Vister. Hmm. And there are rivets.
The statue is there to make people want to be like him.
<b>STRIVE</b>.
?What about the praise floating around?
This is the other of the two things.
Re-scan the rivets spelling praise.
<b>ASPIRE</b>!
?What is the END PRONER POD for?
You need to think your way around it.
Its title is in red, and if you read it, there's red writing too.
DENORP is what the letters are in alphabetical order.
So have a think on what they could be.
<b>PONDER</b>.
?What's with Sectarian Craniates?
It's optional.
But you can get something from it.
<b>ASCERTAIN</b>.
>>UPSCALE CAPSULE
?What should I do with the red vees?
Don't overthink it or get too abstract.
Believe you can and should.
The names of the creators are Ed Evers and Erv Dees, in red.
<b>DESERVE</b> it.
?I'm not worth my salt!
You will be, with time.
If you haven't dealt with the lobster or the stream, you need to.
Then, you need to <b>LAST</b>.
?What do I do with the Trance Nectar?
It's time to turn your back on all this.
But first, you must dispose of the Marble Blamer or the Sister Tressi Siters.
<b>RECANT</b>.
?Is the Marble Blamer relevant?
Yes.
It focuses you on grueling work that drains your soul.
Unless you <b>RAMBLE</b>.
?Are the Sister Tressi Siters relevant?
Yes.
She looks down at you as if you think you're a failure. Or if you think you aren't, because you're lying to yourself.
You can <b>RESIST</b>.
?Is <i>Creationism, Reactionism</i> important?
It's TERRIBLY important for society, I'm sure. But not necessarily to you.
You can daydream one last time to ignore it.

>>LOFTIER TREFOIL
?How do I get out?
Get rid of Rodney and his followers.
They're not really dedicated to him. Get rid of three--any three--of the six, and he can't resist. You can get rid of all six for maximum points.
You can get a clue what sort of word to use if you listen to Rodney's babble about people that didn't make the cut.
He describes them with anagramming adjectives.
Once they're gone, you can send him <b>YONDER</b>.
Or you can make him <b>DRONEY</b> and his followers will get bored.
>>>RODNEY'S GOONS
?How do I get rid of the goons? And why are so many listed? I only see six, plus Rodney.
One henchman is chosen from each pod below. Five groups have four, and the final, largest group has five. They are weighted by length and number of unique permutations.
Geno, Royce, Tyson, Wade.
Daryl, Dewey, Goldy, Shane.
Blake, Bredo, Edwin, Eldon.
Archie, Barney, Ernest, Reggie.
Andres, Andrew, Marcel, Marlon.
Cedrick, Demitri, Leander, Preston, Terrance.
Incidentally, there are more y's than on average in the game. That's good news if you're using your settler. The probability of getting a Y is 1-(3/4*1/2*1/4)=55/64~90.6%. The expected number of Y's is 1.5.
Andrew has a particularly silly description.
?Andres

<b>WARNED</b>.
?Archie

Make it <b>TALCIER</b>.
>>TOPSIDE DEPOSIT
?What can I do with the top opt pot?
Nothing, until near the end.
?What can I do with the start tarts?
You can put them in the toaster, and it will give you the ability to XRAY something for a hint.
?What's the toaster for?
It's a Rosetta toaster.
Put bready snacky products, like the tarts, in the toaster, and you can see through stuff to what it should be.
There are five, total.
The start tarts are right there in Topside Deposit.
The brownies are in the yurts in Scope Copse.
The loaves are from the agnostic after you help them stop reading their book.
The strudel is in Fringe Finger.
The eclairs are in Treading Gradient, beneath the denim.
Budget as you need to.
?Is there any functional difference between the pastries I find? And how many are there?
No. They are all the same.
?What are the dreads adders for? How can I get by?
They are just blocking you from the rest of the Wildest Wilteds.
They inspire dread, but maybe you can make them into a less draining emotion. Or an emotion that drains them.
Make them <b>SADDER</b>.
A general hint for the area follows.
Comparative adjectives help a lot, so it's worth looking for those suffixes to try for a quick solution. -ER is not the only one.
-EST is also worth a look. So is -ING.
But -ER is most likely to occur, since there are only two letters you need for it.
>>GUARDIANS, GUARDIANS
?How many are there? How many do I need to clear?
Well, eighteen or twenty. Two pairs are swappable--there are a male and female deal seer, and you only see one. Likewise with Lois the Hostile and the Hostile-is-He Lot.
You must clear twelve, though clearing more gives access to hinting items and also makes walking around easier.
Twelve are in the main area. You must clear six of them to gain access to the three other corners of the map (northwest, southeast, northeast.) Then you must clear the other guardians in the Actionless Coastlines. That's seven more, for eight total.
You must also clear the way to the Obscurest Subsector. A sequence of two guardians blocks you there.
You must get past the mardier admirer to reach the Shaven Havens.
You must also get past the bluster butlers to reach the Outer Route.
The angriest ingrates and natives' site van guard areas you don't need to visit.
?What's the quickest way?
You must zap at least seven guardians connecting the center area. You can actually avoid visiting (Saltbed and Strait) or (Everglade and Deltas).
The minimum guardians to zap are clued very tangentially by the spec-o-scope, which says HI. This is a bit obscure, but it clues that H or I shaped paths can be cleared to get there.
The H corresponds to clearing the west and east sides, as well as west and east in the Treading Gradient. The I corresponds to the north and south sides, as well as north and south in the Treading Gradient. The next hints contain rough reasoning why you need to clear seven guardians inside the three-by-three area.
This isn't the only way to do things, but it's the most intuitive, because it isn't that crooked, and the HI seems easiest. It took me a while to see the other shortest way through.
You must clear the two guardians from the Coastlines, so we'll always assume they are gone. This makes the calculations easier.
You need to clear (1) either Muscly or the diners in Scope Copse, to start. Also, you need to clear (2) a guardian to get to the Cinema, another (3) to get to the Gradient, another (4) to get to the Garden, and a final one (5) to get to either the Strait or the Deltas. Give yourself one point for each task you haven't got, and that's how many guardians, minimum, you need to dispel.
The proof this is necessary and sufficient is not too bad, I think. First, if you just got a Copse guardian, then you can make the I or H for 4 left. You will get to 2, 3 or 4 next. Whichever you get to, it is a step away from 5, which is a step away from the other 2 of 2, 3 and 4. So each time you reach a new category/room, your point total goes down by 1. If you reach 5, then the remaining of 2, 3 and 4 are all 1 away. If you reach other than 5, then 5 is still 1 away, after which the remaining of 2, 3  and 4 will be one away. Discussion of guardian balance follows.
The game is balanced so that both the h-shaped path and the i-shaped path through the main square in Towers are approximately equal. Or the words to anagram have roughly the same total complexity or number of possibilities.
The teach-mode possibilities are roughly balanced, at a ratio of 135/128 for the produces of the "H" and "I" guardians. Why, yes, I wrote a program to balance them. It's not too bad.
I did this before I realized there were alternate routes through. There are 5 not counting symmetry/rotation.
NEESNNWW, NENWEESS, NNEESWES (this has 5 rotations/reflections. The others have 1.), NNSEES (the H/I), EEWNENWW.
?Can I walk around guardians I can't solve?
Any one guardian? Probably, except the ones who guard dead-end rooms.
You must defeat the atheists, the Lois or the Hostile-is-He Lot, the bonker and stinger, and the admirer. Oh, and the Dreads Adders to start.
?How can I figure guardians a bit more easily?
Trying to walk past, attack or talk to them may give clues.
Of course, you can x-ray them.
The agnostic and Dr. Yow also give one clue.
>>>Specific internal guardians (alphabetical order)
?Alarming Grailman
You can't be a grailman unless you are a cut above.
He can't imagine being worse than average.

?Asset-Hit Atheists
They're patient and willing to explain their views.
Could you make them hurry up so they give up?
Yes, make them <b>HASTIEST</b>.
?(Deal Seer) Lars Eede/Elsa Erde
The deal seer hits the Reed's Ale quite hard!
They feel trapped in their life and can't stop drinking.
You can help them get <b>RELEASED</b>.
The Reed's ale can also become RESEALED.
?Denier Nereid
They're too far from shore. They need to be pulled back in.

?The fluster-self rut
It is agitated, and it agitates you.
How can you calm things down?
Make everything more <b>RESTFUL</b>.
?Hostile-is-He Lot/Lois the Hostile
They're very hostile. The opposite of what you'd expect. They're planning a hostile ol' heist.
Make them feel differently.
Make them the <b>HOLIEST</b>.
?Promise Imposer
He's good at what he does.
So smooth. Doesn't do things by half-measures.
<b>SEMIPRO</b>.
?Realist tailers
They're not nasty enough to reject outright.
Maybe you can feel better ditching them, or maybe they will fight each other, if they become ...
... <b>SALTIER</b>.
?Resident Trendies
Make them far less cool.
They could become <b>NERDIEST</b>.
?Snider diners
They have dry wit.
Until they're <b>RINSED</b>.
?Sweatier wait-seer
He doesn't seem to get tired of blocking you.
Make him <b>WEARIEST</b>.
?Traipse Pirates
They have impressive tans they're proud of.
How to make the pirates lose them?
Make them <b>PASTIER</b>.
?Hey! What's this yacker keycar doing?
It appears the first time you clear an area of all the guardians.
It's pretty easy to dispose of as an LLP.
It's active and has no mechanical damage...
...until you make it <b>CREAKY</b>.
>>SCOPE COPSE
?What's the scope for?
It shows you where you need to go.
It also creates a map in the upper window that lasts until you cross the lake.
?What are the try-us yurts doing? How can I get rid of them?
They're quite eco-friendly, or seem to be. They seem well built enough.
Unless, or until, they're <b>RUSTY</b>.
?How do I get rid of the Bluster Butlers?
Making them more circumspect could help them move up in the world and away from this not-so-posh place.
They can become <b>SUBTLER</b>.
>>ANEMIC CINEMA
?Do I need to deal with the mardier admirer?
(S)he'd find you less a part of his/her life...
...if (s)he were <b>MARRIED</b>.
?Do I need to deal with the angriest ingrates?
Only if you want a perfect score.
If the madness became whining...
...they could be <b>ANGSTIER</b>.
>>DANGER GARDEN
?Do I need to get rid of the bonker?
Yes, it guards something important.
It works perfectly.
Well, until it's <b>BROKEN</b>.
Oh, look, something else! They must be guarding something REALLY important.
?Hey, something replaced the bonker!
The stinger sure is vigilant.
How to lower its energy?
Make it <b>RESTING</b>.
?Do I need to get rid of the natives' site van?
Only for maximum points.
These guys could be one thing, or the other.
If you want to sucker them with pride, <b>VAINEST</b>.
If you want to sucker them with stupidity, <b>NAIVEST</b>.
Neither is better or worse than the other.
>>LOCATIONS THAT DON'T 100% MATTER
?Which ones have nothing besides guardians?
While you have to go through the Scope Copse, and you have to pick off the guardians there, there's nothing critical. Though having the map is helpful.
Artist Traits Strait and Salted Deltas have nothing else, though you'll probably wind up going through both of them. Strictly speaking, you don't have to visit one of them, but it'd be inconvenient to avoid them deliberately.
Danger Garden and Anemic Cinema have guardians you need to pass, but there's nothing else there you need to deal with.
Baldest Blasted Saltbed and Leveraged Everglade have scenery that gives LLPs. Strictly speaking, you don't have to visit both of them, but you have to visit one to get to the edges.
Fringe Finger and Lost Lots have pastries and an LLP each, but nothing critical.
>>BALDEST BLASTED SALTBED
?What's the docile old ice for?
An LLP.
You can change it to something more interesting.
Make it <b>COILED</b>.
>>LEVERAGED EVERGLADE
?What are the organised ego drains doing?
You can't actually dispel them so you can get past them, but you can still hit them up for a Last Lousy Point.
They make you feel like you can't do anything, and they're very reasonable and not overdone.
You can laugh at them if they become <b>GRANDIOSE</b>.
>>OUTER ROUTE
?What's the campiest campsite for?
To hold the diverse deviser.
Campiest Campsite was once the name of a room, but it was a bit too obvious. Or implement a full campsite. But I didn't want to remove it completely.
?How do I get the diverse deviser to work?
It needs an upgrade. Or to be described as upgraded.
It needs to be REVISED.
?What's the diverse deviser for?
Fixing worn down swordy things.
You may've dug one up elsewhere.
It's behind the weeds in the Treading Gradient.
The ragged dagger.
PUT DAGGER IN REPAIR.
?What are the sway-ways for?
They are scenery to "help" you "decide" to go back east.
>>TREADING GRADIENT
?Do I need to get rid of the weeds?
No, but you can (and need to) make them immobile.
Make them <b>SEWED</b>.
?What's a raves saver?
A tape recorder.
Note it can RETAPE or REPEAT.
You'll need to use both to get through.
If you notice its brand name, you can get an LLP.
It's a replay player.
So it can be <b>PEARLY</b>, too.
?What's the denim for?
You can't cut at it with anything normal.
It can, however, be <b>MINED</b>.
?What's the ragged dagger for?
It needs to be toned up.
You'll find something for that in the Campiest Campsite.
PUT DAGGER IN REPAIR.
The gizmo is handy later.
>>DIRE AND ARID DEN
?Help! How did I get down here?
You looked around after poking at everything in Treading Gradient.
You are feeling drained, but you'll need a pick-me-up.
Get <b>DANDIER</b>.
>>SHAVEN HAVENS
?What can I do with the duck?
It has a nametag.
Have you seen anyone by that name?
Dr. Yow is locked up in the subsector.
You can't move Dr. Yow to the Shaven Havens, but you can move Dr. Yow's voice.
The duck might trust that.
>>FRINGE FINGER
?What can I do about the strudel?
You can just take it. Or you can take it with style.
Doing so is a last lousy point.
It can be <b>RUSTLED</b>.
>>LOST LOTS
?What are the sporties' ripostes for?
An LLP.
You can make them less incisive.
They're almost like poetry.
So change them to the <b>PROSIEST</b> you've heard.
?How do I get past the gasfield?
Well, you don't need to.
And you can't.
>>OBSCUREST SUBSECTOR
?How do I undo the prison ropins?
Read them for a clue.
If only they could be <b>UNLOCKED</b>. But you can't just say so.
?How do I get Dr. Yow to speak?
Scanning gives a word...
...or two.
<b>ROWDY</b> is one.
<b>WORDY</b> is the other.
Dr. Yow's voice is useful.
But the duck probably doesn't need Dr. Yow yelling.
?Is a log-gaol important?
Yes, to make the subsector obscurest.
It wouldn't be very obscure if it had more than one exit, would it?
?Is the fissure important?
Try making it <b>FUSSIER</b>.
Nothing happens--with just you there.
?The prison ropins don't have anything I can unlock!
Right. You'll need help.
The lone duck may be a clue.
If only it were in the subsector!
How could you lure it there?
By moving Dr. Yow's voice over.
The raves saver can record it.
PUSH RETAPE after getting Dr. Yow to speak.
PUSH REPEAT in the Shaven Havens.
Return.
?Is Dr. Yow good for anything else?
Yes. Don't go on til you see someone new on the Coastlines.
The agnostic is interested in technical stuff.
Playing the raves saver isn't enough.
?How should Dr. Yow lecture the agnostic?
<b>WORDY</b> has been done. This is an exciting lecture. Or it needs to be. The agnostic still is shaking off the effects of time wasted by the Actionless Coastlines.
<b>ROWDY</b>.
?The agnostic looks tentative. Can I change that?
This is an LLP. It was part of the main puzzle before I felt it was a bit arbitrary. The word was too long, and it was too easy in cheat mode.
TENTATIVE can become...
...<b>ATTENTIVE</b>.
>>ACTIONLESS COASTLINES
?What are the natatorium and hatchery for?
They are convenient places for the atheists and hostile person/people to go once you've neutralized them.
There's no way to enter.
?Somebody seems to be hiding. What gives?
The hastiest atheists and Lois the Hostile, or the Hostile-is-He Lot, are hard to hang with.
You need to get rid of them both. When they do, someone new will appear.
?Does the agnostic really like that book so much?
No. It's something to do, something he/she guesses smart people do.
Maybe if it were less enthralling to look at.
_Reading a Dinger_ can become...
...<b>GRAINED</b>.
?What's the agnostic interested in?
Technical stuff. Like Dr. Yow knows. Dr. Yow's in the subsector.
ASK AGNOSTIC ABOUT DOCTOR once you rescued the doctor.
?The agnostic needs a tool. What's a good one?
The gizmo will be useful. It baffles you--and, well, me, to be honest. I just sort of take the best anagrams available.
GIVE GIZMO TO AGNOSTIC.
?Is the, uh, a bot-boat safe?
Not even close, to start.
The turbos and blaster are broken.
You need to fix one, preferably both.
The turbos can be more <b>ROBUST</b>.
The blaster can be <b>STABLER</b>.
?Is the weirder red wire good/bad for anything?
It's not critical to the game.
It doesn't replace fixing the turbos or blaster.
But it is a Last Lousy Point.
It can be reorganized...
...or <b>REWIRED</b>.
>>RAWEST WATERS
?I need help from the Earnest Eastern Neaters!
If only they were a bit closer...
What can be done to get closer to them?
Make them, and you, <b>NEAREST</b>.
?Hey! I never saw this location. What gives? Is this a fake clue?
You skip over Rawest Waters if you fix a bot-boat completely. If you'd only half-fixed it, you'd have landed here. The puzzle is about as easy as the other two, and I figured it'd be neat to have two ways through.
>>LEAK LAKE
?What does Elk Akela want?
Akela is waiting for Kala Keel, obviously.
AKA Kelle.
If you're very careful and you've already solved Store P, you can hook back to a hidden path under Harm's Marsh and Mount Um-Not to reveal a rare secret.
It's so rare, it's not even in the game, because there's no way to get to Leak Lake. Leak Lake is just a backdrop.
Yeah, I had to write in a joke clue. Right after one people might think was a joke, just for extra misdirection.
Oh, and before a location people might think was a joke, too. Minor spoiler!
>>DOUREST DETOURS
?Is this location a joke?
Well, not a total joke. It's there, but it's a bit floating.
You can enter it from some of the dead-end palces. Outer Route, Lost Lots or Shaven Havens. Fringe Finger has a cliff below, Obscurest Subsector is a prison, and Topside Deposit would be too confusing to start.
Once you've been through once, you can't return.
?Am I trapped?
No. You need an anagram for dourest and detours.
You need something that will wake you up, get you going.
<b>ROUSTED</b>.
?Can I take care of the seismal semials?
Yes, but you don't need to.
They can become <b>AIMLESS</b>.
>>MISLIT LIMITS
?What can I do about the Repents Serpent serpent?
You don't need to get rid of it, strictly. Unless you want to complete the top opt pot side quest for maximum points.
You can't make it go away.
But you can neutralize it so it gets bored and goes off on its own.
It'll be calmer if it's just <b>PRESENT</b>.
?What's with the unripe ur-pine?
It's not critical to solving this area, but it'll help with Renato's quest.
It's too big, and it's covering something up.
Maybe if it were smaller...
...or <b>PUNIER</b>.
?And with what's behind it?
The Nastier Stainer Retinas may be a bit too nasty for their own security.
Because Nastier has the last three letters in common with ...
... <b>ANTSIER</b>.
Oh, look! A succor crocus.
?There aren't many hints here for the curst palace!
If you opened the premise(s), you can return, talk to the person inside once you gained their trust, and come back. There'll be new clues.
Scan them all and eventually you can narrow it down.
?Eleven letters for the curst palace? Really?
It is a big castle. And it's a final puzzle.
St. Teri seems to indicate it inspires generic superlatives.
Like fantastic, incredible...
...remember, it was great once...
...<b>SPECTACULAR</b>.
>>MESPRISE PREMISES
?Do I actually need to be here?
Only if you want full points.
?The Tetris Sitter seems happy as-is!
Not really. Just wasting time, guessing she is happy.
Maybe you could get her back to real emotions ...
... by making her <b>TRISTE</b>.
?How do I get any useful concrete information from the (ex-)Tetris Sitter?
Give him a gift.
If you found the crocus behind the unripe ur-pine, you can do so.
>STORE Y
>>POSH HOPS SHOP
?Why do the pills have a warning?
They're dangerous.
Dangerously addictive, because they allow a free pass through some puzzles here.
If you <b>SPILL</b> the PILLS, in various places, they do different things. But you only get one use.
Okay, more, if you save before using. Or you have a debug version of the binary I used to test the feature. Which was fun.
?What do I need to do to get by the LOLstr trolls?
Well, you need to be all cool.
<b>STROLL</b>.
That won't work right away, though. You need to do a few things to be a more undesirable patron.
?What's the gins sign for?
It should suggest a standard Inform verb when you examine it--or by its letters.
<b>SING</b>.
?What's the perma-amper for?
You can fiddle with it if you know the technical terms.
<b>REMAP</b> it. This means you can't deal with the tunes for a point.
?Can I get rid of the tunes?
Sure.
Just <b>UNSET</b> them. This means you can't deal with the amper for a point.
?What are the tips pits for?
Well, you can put something else in there.
Do something even ruder than not tipping.
<b>SPIT</b>.
?Can/should I bug Casper?
He has good general information.
But you can also do something to irritate him.
Casper Spacer, Capers Recaps...
<b>SCRAPE</b>.
?What do I do with the stein?
Well, there are tines.
You can't quite INSERT...
...but you can <b>INSET</b>.
?Why can't I do more than three annoying things here?
The trolls would get too upset and would have an excuse to give you the business.
>>OLDE LODE
?What's the clam doing?
It's agitated.
Perhaps you can <b>CALM</b> it.
?What's this urn? Why can't I walk away?
Taking it kills you.
You need to do something faster than walk.
You need to <b>RUN</b>.
>>DISEASE SEASIDE
?What're the boats for?
You can make some noise to get their attention.
If you SOB AT them, they're not interested.
You need to <b>BOAST</b>.
That gets you to the Fighter Frigate.
?Can I cross on the frat raft?
Yes, and you get an extra point for doing so.
The oars on the raft are odd.
Get on the raft first. What can you do there? Something stereotypically frat-ish?
<b>FART</b>.
The oars are fuller now. You can't cross the river at ground level...
<b>SOAR</b>.
?Is the canoe useful?
Well, to see ALL the game, yes.
You can turn it into an ocean...
...but that's counterproductive.
It's just a dumb joke/Monty Python reference. You can undo the silly death.
>>FIGHTER FREIGHT
?How do I get out of here?
Once you're on the fighter frigate, your next action should be pretty clear.
The scary crays aren't going to help, but the pale plea might.
You need to <b>LEAP</b>.
?I didn't get here. How do you?
BOAST instead of using the raft at Disease Seaside.
>>ANGER RANGE
?How to stop the bullies?
Hmm. Carps and Pikes.
You can <b>SCRAP</b> with the carps...
...or you can <b>SPIKE</b> the pikes.
Either way, you take care of them all.
?How do I release the haunter?
Etahn Ru is its name. Lots of red letters!
You need to <b>UNEARTH</b> it.
But you also need to help it recover its ruby.
Don't go on 'til you've found a jewel.
There's one inside the Paw-R-Wrap.
He will take revenge on whoever stole it.
What can you do with a ruby?
<b>BURY</b> it.
You'll need the right tool.
And the right place.
?Why's Anger Range so angry?
The haunter lies beneath.
You must release him to make him less angry.
You need to <b>UNEARTH</b> him once you have a shovel. Or, well, something like it.
Say, a rigged digger.
?How do I calm the ghost down once he's here?
The haunter is a Use-Saga Sausage.
<b>ASSUAGE</b> him.
?What's with the snarled darnels?
They won't stop you, but if you're a completionist, they're fun.
You can do something relatively active or forceful to show they're kind of irking you.
SLANDER them.
?Why did Anger Range change names?
Well, nobody's angry any more. So there's no point.
Also, Hero's Shore is the old name of the Disease Seaside.
So I moved it over.
I did a lot of this, even after the first release. Most of the time, I wonder why I didn't do things this way in the first place.
>>HARDEST TRASHED DEARTHS
?What do I do with the cans?
You don't have to do anything.
This is maybe the second-easiest LLP in the game to Peg A. Page's revolting book.
Easier, since it's a verb you probably already used.
<b>SCAN</b> the cans.
?No one's here but I hear something.
They're EEKS.
Try to <b>SEEK</b> them.
>>LEAN LANE
?What does Aunt Tuna want me to do?
She informs you her nephew the trout's name is Tortu. He hates bullies.
He needs to be taught.
You can <b>TUTOR</b> him.
Then you get what's in the raw red drawer.
?What do I do with the tea?
It's not the sort of tea you can drink, and with five anagram possibilities, you can use process of elimination, here.
You <b>EAT</b> it.
The paler pearl is useful later.
?Are the wipes usable/takeable?
Yes and yes.
First, let's figure how to take them.
We need to take them quickly.
<b>SWIPE</b> them.
?Is the dent in the desk useful?
No, except for getting one more point.
It's a rather easy point. Let's just say if you scan it in cheat mode, it falls out.
?What do I do with the Paw-R-Wrap?
You <b>WARP</b> it.
Well, not in front of Aunt Tuna. But someone else will deserve and loathe it more.
?What can I ask Aunt Tuna about?
She will tell you about her friend Valeri who gave her a packet.
Which you can get, or you do have.
It's what the ghost is after.
?Can I fix the dent?
Yes and no. You can't FIX it. That's only three letters...
...but you can <b>TEND</b> it.
?Can I go back to the Hardest Trashed Dearths?
No, but you don't need to.
>>LAPSIN' PLAINS
?How do I unlock the span pans?
Three parts to this one, but they're all relatively short.
The skis and knob are in the way.
<b>KISS</b> the skis.
The knob is also stuck.
<b>BONK</b> the knob.
Then you should be able to <b>SNAP</b> to get rid of the pans.
But wait! A crate.
?How do I avoid being hit by a crate?
This is another two-parter.
They're too broken to cater with.
You need to figure where it's coming from.
<b>TRACE</b> it.
But that's not enough. You need to avoid it.
<b>REACT</b>.
?Anything else I can do?
You can talk to nobody in general for a last lousy point.
What is the location's name?
PLAINS.
You can do something with that. It's a bit slangy, but...
...you can <b>SPLAIN</b> your goals and dreams and wishes.
>>SHUTTLE HUTLETS
?What do I do with the tubs?
Maybe there is something inside.
You need to break them open.
Or <b>BUST</b> them.
?What the heck can I do with a prod?
The way to open it is simple yet annoyingly weird.
<b>DROP</b> the prod.
?Does the waste need clearing?
Not if you don't want ALL the points.
It's work to clear.
<b>SWEAT</b>.
?Can I do anything with the heaps I left?
Yes, but you don't have to.
They're lumped inartistically.
This is a last lousy point.
<b>SHAPE</b> the heaps.
?What do I do with a dirty lance?
You need the wipes from Lean Lane.
Then you can <b>CLEAN</b> the lance.
?What do I do with the rigged digger?
Two things. First, it can release the haunter...
...if you <b>UNEARTH</b>.
Second, once you have the ruby...
...you can <b>BURY</b> it.
?How do I bring a plane into the Shadier Airshed?
Well, you need to manipulate the panel.
You need to uncover it first.
There was a panel in Shuffling Around.
How did you get it?
By folding a paper plane.
I didn't want to reuse an anagram, so...
...there is no plane. I just</b>
?How do I operate the plane?
You can't operate the buttons, but...
I bet a nuts bot could.
You could make it respect you if you told it tut, snob...
...And if there actually was a nuts bot in the game. Or, well, buttons. Or a plane.
>>SCLEROUS CLOSURES
?Do the arches hide anything?
Yes. Examining's not enough.
You have to <b>SEARCH</b>. But the sardine will block you.
?How do I get rid of the sandier sardine?
The sardine hates noises.
You need something that makes noises.
Here's where you <b>WARP</b> the bubble wrap.
Now you can SEARCH.
?What's the Handsome Sand Home for?
To add plausibility for the game blocking you from going west or south.
Also as a memorial for Lean Lane's previous name.
>>HORNED HEDRON
?How do I get rid of the weaselly walleyes?
They're not scared of much.
The ghost might scare them.
If the ghost passed by them to find a ruby, they'd be scared.
?How do I disable the ol' trap?
Well, first, you need to get rid of the walleyes.
It would be nice as a portal.
You must be able to disable it somewhere.
Look around.
Better yet, <b>PATROL</b>.
Of course, you need the walleyes gone.
>>RASCAL CRAALS
?What is a craal?
It's a place of living.
Not a super fancy one, but it sure sounds exotic!
?What can I do here?
This is a good place to hide stuff.
Like the ruby.
<b>BURY</b> the RUBY.
Then dig the haunter up and lead it by.
?I can't visit the craals after doing something. Is this okay?
Yes. The craals served their purpose. And besides, the residents might recognize you.
>>END DEN
?Is this where I want to be?
No. You got here because you don't have a map to the Horned Hedron, yet.
Did you find a pearl yet?
Once you get two, they make a general gleaner.
It's not big enough to see into clearly.
<b>ENLARGE</b> it.
>>PLASM LAMPS
?I didn't see this! Is it a fake room or clue?
No, it's a small side quest.
You need something from the Shuttle Hutlets.
The lance. If you have it, and you've done what you need with it, something will pop up in the Den Loft.
You will need to figure what to do with the Templar Ramplet. It's part of the puzzle.
?What do I do with the natant ant?
It should be easy. There are only five possibilities.
You need to attack it a certain way.
There are only five possibilities for ANT.
You need to <b>TAN</b> it.
Once you do, you go to the den loft.
?Okay, was/is there anything else to do? That was a bit anticlimactic.
Yes. The location itself has a bit of a hint.
A templar is a religious fighter. Maybe you can do a religious thing?
This word is better known as a noun, but it can also function as a verb.
You can <b>PSALM</b> while in Plasm Lamps for a bonus point on top of getting rid of the natant ant.
>>TENFOLD TEFLON'D DEN LOFT
?Stupid papery yapper!
The papery yapper wants to be bribed, but use a different word, maybe?
A synonym for quid pro quo?
<b>PREPAY</b> the yapper.
You lose the general gleaner, but you know the way by now, anywayy.
?What do I do with the lever?
It's an optional point.
Have fun knowing you found it.
<b>REVEL</b>.
?Can I walk down the Templar Ramplet?
Well, not quite walk.
Also, you need the lance from the Shuttle Hutlets.
Once you do, you can walk in quite aggressively. It leads to a new location.
<b>TRAMPLE</b>.
?What do I do with the dialer?
There's also a clump of letters that can be relaid.
DIALER may become something else.
<b>DERAIL</b>.
?Oh no! Pins are blocking the dialer!
Two solutions here.
They aren't lethal, but they are annoying.
You may notice SNIPping them doesn't work, but that's very close.
<b>SPIN</b> them.
?What else do I do with the dialer?
Well, you can DERAIL again...
...or you can find another way to call back.
<b>REDIAL</b>.
>STORE T
>>MINDED MIDDEN
?Help! I lost my powers! What do I do?
You're severely weakened.
What's the least powerful type of word in the English language?
The adverb.
The bleary barley covers everything...
...<b>BARELY</b>.
?Ed Riley won't let me by!
He's not a YIELDER.
He won't even share his DELI RYE.
His voice sure booms.
Not if he speaks <b>REEDILY</b>.
?Cinders? What for?
You can use them to <b>DISCERN</b> what word to use.
Showing you don't need them gets another point.
You can also <b>RESCIND</b> them.
>>DISOWNED DOWNSIDE
?Why can't I go west?
First, you need to help Gretta Garett-Tatger, whom Elmo told you about.
Then, you need your powers back to dispose of the moat.
?How do I disperse the parleys splayer players?
They're talking total rubbish.
But they have enough style points, they can't be caalled on it yet.
You can only use adverbs to take them down, so look for words with L and Y in them.
There're many possibilities, but you only need three before they lose their mojo. You don't have to respond right away to how they talk, either.
There's also one word that's available no matter how they talk.
They can talk <b>SPARELY</b>. That's always available, until you figure it.
They cycle through seven things to say. These are determined randomly before the game starts. Any one word is at least seven letters long. There are seven pods of words, and I ch
There are other shorter ones, too. Below is an explanation of the pods I choose the adverbs from. The easy ones come first.
Pod 1 is seven letters, with some repeating. <b>BOSSILY</b>, <b>CATTILY</b>, <b>SEEDILY</b>, <b>TEARILY</b> (or <b>IRATELY</b>) and <b>TERSELY</b> are in Pod 1.
Pod 2 is seven letters, non-repeating. So you always have two seven-letter words. <b>ANGRILY</b>, <b>NASTILY</b>, <b>SHADILY</b>, <b>SNIDELY</b> and <b>STARKLY</b> are in Pod 2.
Pod 3 is eight letters, repeating. <b>BLEARILY</b>, <b>RIBALDLY</b>, <b>FORMALLY</b>, <b>COITALLY</b>, <b>SHABBILY</b>, <b>SHODDILY</b>, <b>SILENTLY</b> and <b>SUDDENLY</b> are in Pod 3.
Pod 4 is eight letters, non-repeating. So you always have two eight-letter words. <b>MODESTLY</b>, <b>STEAMILY</b> and <b>STUPIDLY</b> are in Pod 4.
Pod 5 is nine letters. <b>MARTIALLY</b>, <b>SINCERELY</b>, <b>SOBBINGLY</b>, <b>TEDIOUSLY</b> and <b>WEARINGLY</b>are in Pod 5.
Pod 6 is ten to eleven letters. <b>DESPERATELY</b>, <b>DRAWLINGLY</b>, <b>EMOTIONALLY</b> and <b>REACTIVELY</b> are in Pod 6.
Pod 7 is twelve letters. <b>DESPAIRINGLY</b> and <b>INDISCREETLY</b> are in Pod 7.
The pods give you slightly more average letters to deal with than if I just picked seven adverbs from the whole list (thirty-two at last count,) but I felt it might be too confusing to have thirty-two possible adverbs to deal with instead of seven. The sizes are, as of release 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 5, 2 and 1.
?What good are Gretta's medals?
Not very good, right now. They're tarnished. You need to fix that.
Since they say IQ and LUCKY, you may be able to guess what they become. But if you figure them now, you haven't done enough good, yet.
Incidentally, they're roughly inspired by the medals worn by the protagonist of Saki's <i>The Storyteller</i>.
?How do I dispose of the moat?
You have to get your powers back.
Then, you can make it something much smaller.
An <b>ATOM</b>.
?Where do I go first, north or south?
You only need to go one of north or south from the Disowned Downside. The Loop Pool is a bit easier. But going both ways gets you all the points.
>>SHINER SHRINE
?The sly imp simply blocks me!
LY-words again can get around it. Make it less sly.
With LEGENDARY patience, BUTLERY and MOTLEYER.
You only need two of three. Make it lose its cool.
<b>BRUTELY</b> is the shortest.
<b>REMOTELY</b> is next-shortest.
<b>ENRAGEDLY</b> is the longest.
?What is the coma camo for? And the message?
The message is what this room--or the cathedral--was called in previous releases.
The camo just stops you from going west or east.
>>CLARTHEAD CATHEDRAL
?The shrewin' whiners block me noisily!
Their TALLYHOING, CALLOSITY and JOLLITY get in the way.
Tune their volume down. Disrupt them. Make them take a break.
You need two of three.
<b>JOLTILY</b> costs the fewest keystrokes.
<b>STOICALLY</b> is next.
<b>LOATHINGLY</b> is the longest solution.
>>LOOP POOL
?The sea cube...
You can't waste words.
But no adverbs seem to work.
What word is meaningless by itself?
A conjunction.
<b>BECAUSE</b>.
?The eels aren't convinced...
Tell them 'Or...
...<b>ELSE</b>.'
?Is "Sullenness, Us" important?
It appears when you have your powers back. It's just another bonus point.
To get rid of it, say <b>UNLESS</b>.
>>BRAN BARN
?Mr. Lee says 'Hola Thug!' as he wears a ghoul hat.
You have one word to grab his attention...
...a word meaningless by itself...
A conjunction.
<b>ALTHOUGH</b>.
?The gore ogre is now in the way!
You can outfox it with a clever conjunction.
<b>ERGO</b>.
?Is the vow here important?
It appears when you have your powers back. It's just another bonus point.
To get rid of it, say <b>HOWEVER</b>.
>>LAMER REALM
?Owls attack me!
You need your powers back. If you don't have them, come back again.
They kill you if you stay for one move. They're quick!
Unless they are <b>SLOW</b>.
?Why can't I dispel the owls?
You need your powers back first.
Visit the Disowned Downside, if you haven't.
Then clear an area to the north or south.
?What of the other animals?
In order of possible combinations...
The satyr can be <b>ARTSY</b>.
The badger can be <b>GARBED</b>.
The ocelots can be <b>COOLEST</b>.
The leopard can be <b>PAROLED</b>.
?Help! Why did the room name change?
Because you did enough to make it a nice place.
>>PERVERSE PRESERVE
?Whoah! A raptor!
Brute force won't work.
Make it a <b>PARROT</b>.
?Why can't I dispel the raptor?
You need your powers back first.
Visit the Disowned Downside, if you haven't.
Then clear an area to the north or south.
?Nails?
Nothing's slain.
Just an ex-<b>SNAIL</b>.
?Pines aren't an animal!
They have no spine...
They're not a <b>SNIPE</b>.
?The corona is spooky!
It can be a <b>RACOON</b>.
?Thrones?
Buzzing noises? Sting if you sit on it?
<b>HORNETS</b>.
?Help! Why did the room name change?
Because you did enough to make it a nice place.
>>RECLUSION INCLOSURE
?Why are Elmer and Merle doing things on the sly?
You can get the truth out of them.
It's a last lousy point but not a trivial one. Plus they have silly things to say if you trigger it.
You can make them talk <b>HONESTLY</b>.
?Is it significant that Elmer and Merle are ideas aides?
For full points, yes.
You can momentarily push them <b>ASIDE</b> to let them know who they're dealing with. Er, with whom they're dealing.
?How do I go west?
You need something that can beat a hydra. Seen an animal?
The raptor.
Your friend the ex-ex-parrot will help you...
...once it's a <b>RAPTOR</b> again.
?What do I do with the whistle?
Practice when nobody's around.
It sounds like someone yelped, but you need to make it less piercing.
Maybe if you could play it <b>DEEPLY</b>.
That will help summon animal friends later.
>>RANCHO ARCHON ANCHOR
?Does the conversation with Elvira matter?
No.
But she has to say something, doesn't she?
?Elvira is too fast for me!
The whistle on its own doesn't work. Especially if you haven't "adjusted" it.
You may need to retreat and come back to do so.
See the note in the preserve if you're stuck.
Have any other gifts?
The medals, IQ and LUCKY.
Neither alone speeds you up, but they clinked together when you rescued various animals.
So go <b>QUICKLY</b>.
?I need allies!
If you haven't practiced with the whistle, it won't work.
You can step outside if you don't know what to do.
Play it DEEPLY back in the Reclusion Inclosure. Then come back west.
Then just PLAY WHISTLE. You win!
?Should I explore the next area?
Even if you don't right now, you can always ROVE OVER later.
>STORE H
?What does it become?
The clues lead you to somewhere random, different, that doesn't fit in anywhere.
OTHERS.
?I don't get to enter the 'new' area if I restart the game!
This clue is just a buffer so people who viewed this accidentally won't find the shortcut command.
The right command is referenced when you defeat Elvira.
ROVE OVER.
>>RUSTIC CITRUS
?What do I need to do for Curtis?
For starters, get 4 fruits. A few are easy.
The Spear will be <b>PEARS</b>.
Examine the ruts circuits. Then the slime can be <b>LIMES</b>.
The Lumps can be <b>PLUMS</b>.
The Pagers can be <b>GRAPES</b>.
There are more potential fruits, which you may be able to guess, but you only need four to start, and I wanted to make them easy.
?What's the augural arugula for?
Well, it's a cheat item. You can EAT it, then GURU something, and if it can become a fruit, there you go.
But you lose a last lousy point at the end if you GURU something. So it's double-edged, for all you perfectionists out there.
?What's this stupid moss cap for?
The moss cap is supposed to help you with directions.
It doesn't work so well in its present state.
Try making it a <b>COMPASS</b>.
Now you can go north!
?Anything else I can do besides make fruit?
Curtis gives you something new every four fruits. That's a running total, not four fruits since your last transaction.
So it's possible to bring back a bunch of fruits and get all the stuff below.
After the moss cap for the first four, there is
A tekno-token (9 points, 4 more fruits),
A coin (13 points, 8 more fruits),
Another coin (17 points, 12 more fruits),
And a droll dollar (21 points, 16 more fruits).
Beyond that, he just takes stuff. But you don't need any one specific fruit for any quest.
?Is the sated stead useful?
Yes.
It can become <b>DATES</b>.
?Mad Train?
<b>TAMARIND</b>.
?Peanut Cola?
Some clues on the can.
<b>CANTALOUPE</b>.
?What's the omen prism for?
All in red. Clues for a fruit.
You can READ the omen prism to find various red text.
For instance, "Nope, Mr. Sim" sounds almost like...
<b>PERSIMMON</b>.
?Harmonicas?
<b>MARASCHINO</b> (cherry).
?Eerie Blurbs?
Painted blue-purple.
<b>BLUEBERRIES</b>.
?Barren cries?
<b>CRANBERRIES</b>.
?Mopeage rant and other writings?
They're real pips.
<b>POMEGRANATE</b>.
>>SWELL WELLS
?'Elp PSA?
Six letter fruit.
<b>APPLES</b>.
?What about the riot cap?
An <b>APRICOT</b>.
?ScoutCon on Stucco?
<b>COCONUTS</b>.
?And the sorer bogey?
<b>GOOSEBERRY</b>.
?And the green stain?
<b>TANGERINES</b>.
?And the miser ruble?
<b>MULBERRIES</b>.
>>FILED FIELD
?Anything besides fruit here?
No.
?Where is Fidel?
"I fled." He's not coming back.
?Pipe Panel lie pen app?
<b>PINEAPPLE</b>.
?Pryer Bars?
<b>RASPBERRY</b>.
?The buried raft?
Philip Larkin would figure this out, whatever it is.
<b>BREADFRUIT</b>.
?The mean trowel?
<b>WATERMELON</b>.
?Barriers West?

?Barber Sickle?
<b>BLACKBERRIES</b>.
?The rapt figure?
White and pink with a weird spoon.
<b>GRAPEFRUIT</b>.
>>SCAPE SPACE
?How do I trade for the storage?
Got any seedy currency?
Did you try giving the trader a coin?
The coins aren't seedy or valuable enough. Give the trader something more valuable.
Like, after you give Curtis twenty fruits, ...
...the (well, a) droll dollar.
?Do I need any of the fruits down here?
No, and in fact, they're meant to be a bit tricky. To give completionists a real sense of accomplishment.
?What to do with the/a banna'?
The message NAA-NA-B gives you the letters you need. The colors may be a giveaway.
Get a <b>BANANA</b>.
?I can't take the orange!
You're being too direct about it.
Perhaps if you get close...
...or <b>GO NEAR</b>...
?What about the brr hub?
Well, it is actually *a* brr hub, for the purposes of the puzzle.
Attack and poke at it to get seeing-red clues.
Look at it--it wants you to attack it.
Odd things happen. You say odd things.
Burr, Bah, etc.
<b>RHUBARB</b>.
?What's the RESERVED for DR. SEVERE sign for?
It can be <b>REVERSED</b> for a fruit.
A guava, again, something hard to anagram.
>>CLANGIER CLEARING
?What do I do with Len Craig?
You can just trade with him, but general talking won't work.
You'll have to specify the fruits you want or how you want them.
?I figured out a fruit. Why can't I trade?
You need to have currency.
Curtis gives you a tekno-token for fruit number eight. It has credit.
You can get eight fruits all at Rustic Citrus, or you can get them after making the compass.
You don't really need to do anything here to win, but it may be easier than other areas.
?Is there any theme, beyond the obvious?
Not really. This is a sort of runoff area.
Though there are a lot of adjectives.
?Why should I listen?
A voice says 'go, man.'
MANGO isn't quite it.
You need to get <b>AMONG</b>.
?The melon?
That's not the only one Len Craig has.
<b>MO LEN<b> or <b>LEN MO</b> should work.
?The peach?
<b>CHEAP</b>.
?The quince needs something in Italian!
A price, or a number,
Uno, duo, tre, quattre, ...
<b>CINQUE</b>.
?Lemons?
<b>SOLEMN</b>.
?The I-Solve Voiles?
<b>OLIVES</b>.
?The prices precis?
An error makes you want to lash out at the prices precis.
<b>CRIPES</b>!
The kumquat is just a random fruit that was hard to anagram.
?The auction caution?
Says PAY ASAP.
<b>PAPAYAS</b>.
?Nectarine?
Needs to be older.
<b>ANCIENTER</b>.
>>GATES STAGE
?What's behind the gates?
The happy ending.
?How to get through the gates?
You need a passport.
The rest of the questions won't make sense until you talk to Curtis.
?How do I open the storage?
Examining it mentions a lost slot.
You can't see it because it is lost.
You need something to put in the slot.
But not a coin.
?What do I put in the slot?
Coins don't seem to work. Neither does a coin.
The thing doesn't like money--maybe more a token?
Perhaps an <b>ICON</b> would be more your thing.
Or, if you have two coins, they can be <b>ICONS</b>.
?Why does the storage spit my offer out with a hum?
A weird hum. Like sound waves.
You need something to counteract that.
Once you have two coins, you can make them <b>SONIC</b>.
Similarly, ICONS can become <b>SONIC</b>, too.
You can adjust the coins in any order you please to get <b>SONIC ICONS</b>. Well, you can't make a coin SONIC, but you get the idea.
?What do I do with the final item?
It can take you pretty much anywhere.
But you need to pay attention to it.
A viewer and searcher are pretty easy to use. You feel they could be.
<b>REVIEW</b> or <b>RESEARCH</b>.
You're also called a PERP if you try to go to the Valence Enclave.
In that case you could <b>PREP</b> a bit.
You only need to to two of three actions. They were meant to be easy, to emphasize looking stuff up can be easier than abstruse word puzzles.
Just go through the gates for the finale.
?I got the bonus point at the end, but there's still one more! What gives?
Well, the last one is very tricky.
You need to scan the sonic icons for a clue.
They give a ten-letter word which is unusual but not hard to figure.
A word about a different sort of being good with words.
CONCISIONS.
>DEMO DOME MODE
?What do I do here?
You don't need to do much.
Just explore everywhere and examine what you want. The SCORE should keep track of things to you.
?What's Benford's Law?
It's on Wikipedia, yeah, but the example in my own code was maybe a cool learning moment, if you care. And if you clicked here, you actually might.
Benford's Law says that randomly occurring measurements' first digits occur at a rate of [log X+1 - log X] for X from 1 to 9. As long as the measurements span several orders of magnitude.
Of course, you need enough data points to make it significant, too. With 40+, you can start to see the shape.
In my case, the random anagram sets conform to Benford's Law, though it's probably skewed towards the ones digit.
That's because I enjoyed working to round numbers like 1000 or 100 just to hit goals. This was particularly evident when I hit 80 entries.
Since the books hit 6000+ titles (I include both # of entries and KB of entries) I had enough orders of magnitude for Benford's Law to apply. But the general pattern is still pretty clear.
Yay, scientific rules and scientific thinking why data might be skewed! See, this game isn't just about anagrams.
?What's Zipf's law?
It's on Wikipedia, but basically it says naturally countable measurements (like city populations) follow x, x/2, x/3, etc. Or x, x/2^z, x/3^z.
My anagram lists do so--but in two segments. That's probably because I introduced many lists late. You can calculate, though, that it roughly works for the top ten.
Some anagram lists outstripped others at various times. But the laws were still roughly followed.
>GENERAL QUESTIONS FOR YOUR (POTENTIAL) AMUSEMENT
?How many ways are there to die?
Not many. And I think they're relatively obvious deaths. Easily undoable too.
You can curse in the Cleric Circle. (u)
You can turn the BEAN into BANE. (u)
You can troll the trolls four ways instead of three in the Posh Hops Shop. (y)
You can take the urn in the Olde Lode. (y)
You can create an OCEAN where there's a canoe. (y)
You can attack the scary crays on the fighter freight. (y)
You can wait around and not change the owls or the raptor. (t)
You can go west to face Elvira without using the medals. (t)
You can wait around by Elvira, or try to train with the whistle in the Reclusion Inclosure, or attack her directly. (t)
In old versions, you used to get killed by the haunter, but I found that to be too cruel, so now  the game hints the right way to do things instead.
?Bad anagrams:
...making the plates or staple PASTEL, PLEATS or PETALS?
...trying to STUB or say BUTS/BUTS around the tubs?
...making GAPERS around the pagers or grapes?
...saying TARD to get the dart? (don't say this word in real life. It's not nice.)
...saying HORSE at the shore?
...saying EOL or ELO by Leo?
...saying SNOG when you hear the song in the Upscale Capsule?
...saying SPINE around the pines? There's another one, too. It's more colorful. You'll figure it out, but that's part of the fun.
...looking in the source code for the rest? ("table of anayux")
?Is Casper Spacer "anyone"?
He's a lame parody of a pastiche of great writers, but nobody in particular.
He could be the fish equivalent of Hemingway, if you wanted him to be.
Regardless of your opinion of Hemingway's works, I hope you agree with me that there are never enough Hemingway parodies.
?Is Elvira "anyone?"
Not really. But her backhanded compliments and misguided charisma are things I generally find annoying.
The name just worked out right, and I'm no good at making straight-out evil characters.
I hope she felt evil enough for you.
