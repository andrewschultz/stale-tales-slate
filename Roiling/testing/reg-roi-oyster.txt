>gonear posh hops shop
Posh Hops Shop
>storye
[not-the-reg].
>pohs
[locname].
>tien
Just one tine doesn't seem up to much.
>troll
Dealing with just one troll would cause the rest to call you a bully and beat you up. Gotta take [']em all, somehow.
>recpa
Casper glares at you, as if he knows you're thinking all his recaps are the same. No. You [if recaps are reflexive]need to deal[else]already dealt[end if] with them all.
>patrosn
[patron].
>patrno
[patron].
>customre
[patron].
>customesr
[patron].
>tuen
Eh, you know how jukeboxes are. One tune quashed, another pops up. Get rid of [']em all.
>jra
You suspect it's what's in the jar that's important.
>spill
You seem to be fumbling what to do with the pills.
>scralw
It's probably not just any scrawl. What the scrawl says may be important.
>sign
Hm, the sign doesn't strictly disallow THAT.
>tumblre
You can't pick out which tumbler to do something to. But you're annoyed by their tips.
>stumblre
Someone looks at you funny. 'What are you muttering?' [if tumblers are reflexed]You already spit, anyway[else]Maybe it's the writing on the tumblers, instead[end if].
>jukebxo
You can't change the jukebox. The bad music has seeped into it[if tunes are reflexive]. But maybe you can put it out of commission[else]. It's already out of commission for now[end if].
>rempa
You can't change the bad music selection. But you can neutralize it--the jukebox has instructions.
>unste
You can't change the bad music selection. But you can neutralize it--the jukebox has instructions.
>unset

>unste
You can't change the bad music selection. You already got a temporary escape, and that should be good enough.

>sing
>spit
>inset
WRONG

>undo
>stroll
Olde Lode

>loed
[locname].

>caneo
The canoe sways alarmingly. Maybe it isn't the best vessel for crossing the river.
>hosre
You give a few Er-ohs, oh-ers, Or Ehs. You'll probably need to say or do something entirely different to cross the river. There's the raft--those boats. [HERO'S SHORE]
>heor
You give an Er-oh, oh-er, or Eh. You'll probably need to say or do something entirely different to cross the river. There's the raft--those boats.
>soka
[raft-is].
>oka
[raft-is].
>fihs
T'fish won't shift nowt.
>herrign
Nothing doing. It is, after all, a RED herring. Ba dum bum.
>sculptuer
[sculpt].
>cutl
[sculpt].
>supre
[sculpt].
>rivre
[river-no].
>rivear
[river-no].
>ora
If you looked at just one oar, the raft would do no better than go in circles.
>bota
No one boat seems better than the others. Maybe you should widen your focus to all the boats.
>interlockign
Whoah, they're just oars. Think simpler. Much simpler.

>bota
WRONG
>boast

[if player is in range]Deal with the attackers, not the trout[else if wrap is off-stage]You try to describe how to fight, but that's not it[else]You can't find any other way to describe fighting[end if].

Lean Lane
>lena
[locname]. Lena and Neal do live here
>cna
Getting rid of one can would still leave a mess. Maybe you can deal with them all.
>casn
You glance at your settler, wondering what to do with the cans. Maybe you've overlooked something obvious.
>eke
You try to eke out an eek, but you only have one data point, and that's not enough.

>seek
Handsome Sand Home

>handsoem
[locname].
>hoem
[locname-part].
>sadn
[locname-part].
>rewadr
[if wrap is off-stage]Aunt Tuna would probably open the drawer if you helped poor Tortu the Trout[else]There's nothing else in the drawer and no way to get in by yourself[end if].
>bubbel
!It's just wrap, really.
>bubblewrpa
I!t's just wrap, really.
>detn
[if dent is in lalaland]You already fixed the dent. It's gone[else]That's not the way to futz with the dent, though it felt good to grunt while saying it. Or thinking it[end if].
>tuan
She is a bit fussy, but she is more than okay as she is.
>eta
Quit playing with your food, already.
>trya
[just-tea].
>teatrya
[just-tea].
>wiep
It'd be easier to [if player has wipes]use them all[else]steal all the wipes[end if] at once. Pulling them out and so forth--tiring.
>pealr
The pearl is too jagged to change easily, but it seems like it was roughly cut in half. Maybe if you find the other bit...

>tutor
>eat
>bubbel
It's just wrap, really.
>bubblewrpa
!t's just wrap, really.

>swipe
>w
>n

>plani
'I...plan,' you think, then in a fit of confidence, 'I...PLANS!'
>splani
You feel like making a big speech about what you've done and what you plan to do, but not quite like that.
>splain
>splani
You had your say.
>plani
You had your say.

>actesr
Hmm, no, it[if crate is reflexed] was[else]'s[end if] only one crate at a time...

>traec
Yes, one more thing to do with the crate--you know where they're from, and you know what to do. Instinctively.
>trace
by one point
>traec
That won't quite help you figure where the crate is coming from.
>react
by one point
>traec
That's not something

>actesr
Hmm, no, it[if crate is reflexed] was[else]'s[end if] only one crate at a time...

>rued
It's not the rudeness[knob-skis].
>doro
It's not the doorness[knob-skis].
>rudedoro
It's not the whole[knob-skis].
>brife
[prob-ov].
>messaeg
[prob-ov].
>intheer
The words on the door don't change. They are just a generic taunt.
>iks
But you need to remove both skis.
>sksi
>rued
It's not the rudeness[knob-skis].
>doro
It's not the doorness[knob-skis].
>rudedoro
It's not the whole[knob-skis].

>opne
[if door-sux is true]You already opened the door[else]The words 'Nope, peon!' sear into your brain. Perhaps it's a bit more complicated[end if].
>doorknbo
It's just a knob. Which thankfully cuts down the possibilities.

>debrsi
You can't learn much from the debris. You're pretty sure it's from a crate.
>fragmenst
[if crate is reflexed]Not worth messing with the fragments[else]They're fragments of a crate--this may or may not help[end if].
>shtu
[if uaah is visited]You found the hut you needed to[else]The huts are too secure, but maybe you can go by the door[end if].
>intheer
You don't need to mess with the message on the rude door.
>bokn
That isn't quite the right way to hit the knob.

>in
A Hut

>ahtu
[locname]. [UH AT A HUT / AT, UH, A HUT]
>htu
[locname-part].
>sweta
The heaps are still technically waste, but you [if heaps are reflexive]may want to deal with them more delicately[else]beautified them enough[end if].
>utb
Clear ALL the tubs!
>buts
That didn't make anything go boom.
>drpo
You're juggling what to do with the prod, here.
>lanec
The lance is still itself[if lance is cleaned]--and you probably did enough cleaning it[else if player has wipes]--you can't figure how to apply the wipes[else]--but how to make it neater, now[end if].

>bust
>drop prod

>diggre
It's what it needs to be, you imagine.

>shtu
You found the hut you needed to.

>reacsh
[if a-s is reflexed]You did enough with the arches[else]That's not quite what to do with the arches[end if]. [ACHERS' ARCHES]
>hedrno
You'll probably need to destroy the hedron from within.
>arhc
[ache-plur].
>achre
[ache-plur].
>sardien
The sardine gives you a weird look, as if you need to stop mumbling. You're not sure you can do anything to him directly.

>warp
>search
>enlarge
>n
Horned Hedron

>hedrno
[locname].
>thesse
The hedron's spirit will remain intact even if you meddle there. You must go into its heart.
>thees
It'd be fun to rip up even one, but it'd be worse if you got caught. Take down the hedron, instead.
>tapr
You think of changing the trap--maybe even a tarp! But maybe the trap IS a tarp that enfolds you. Scary. No, thinking of it as an ol['] trap would make it less intimidating.
>walleey
Just tacking one walleye won't change the crowd. They're past redemption, anyway.
>walleyse
The walleyes are a bad crowd, past redemption.

>w
>bury ruby

>collapsde
[locname].
>odl
[locname-part].
>placse

That's not quite it. You file that idea six feet under.

The thin hint doesn't reveal anything else.

>e

>unearht
dig up the haunter, now that
>unearth
>unearht
The haunter needs to be dealt with otherwise.
>howlre
Anything can howl, but this is a haunter--and, in fact, it's not just a haunter but a SAUSAGE.

>assuaeg
WRONG
>assuage
>assuaeg
Don't oversell it! Just take the haunter to where it was probably the walleyes who buried the ruby.

WRONG

[locname]. [DEN LOFT]
>lotf
[locname-part].
>dne
[locname-part].
>jumbel
It's the words on the jumble you need to mess with. With which you need to mess[if yapper is in den loft]. Well, once the yapper's out of the way[end if].
>papeyr
'Quit yer mumblin, ya perp!' the yapper yells, turning red. 'You here to do business or not?'
>redila
The yapper might alert his cronies if you try anything. Even something not quite right, like that.

Changing the intercom to a ton-crime intercom would be the opposite of what you want to do.
