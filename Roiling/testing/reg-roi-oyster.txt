>ts
>gonear posh hops shop
Posh Hops Shop
>storye
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
>pohs
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
>tien
Just one tine doesn't seem up to much.
>troll
Dealing with just one troll would cause the rest to call you a bully and beat you up. Gotta take 'em all, somehow.
>recpa
Casper glares at you, as if he knows you're thinking all his recaps are the same. No. You need to deal with them all.
>patrosn
They would resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that.
>patrno
They would resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that.
>customre
They would resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that.
>customesr
They would resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that.
>tuen
Eh, you know how jukeboxes are. One tune quashed, another pops up. Get rid of 'em all.
>jra
You suspect it's what's in the jar that's important.
>splil
You seem to be fumbling what to do with the pills.
>snig
Hm, the sign doesn't strictly disallow THAT.
>tumblre
You can't pick out which tumbler to do something to. But you're annoyed by their tips, which make you see red.
>stumblre
Someone looks at you funny. "What are you muttering?" Maybe it's the writing on the tumblers, instead.
>jukebxo
You can't change the jukebox. The bad music has seeped into it. But maybe you can put it out of commission.
>rempa
You can't change the bad music selection. But you can neutralize it--the jukebox has instructions.
>unste
The tunes grow slightly less annoying, for a moment.

>unset

>unste
You can't change the bad music selection. You already got a temporary escape, and that should be good enough.

>jukebxo
You can't change the jukebox. The bad music has seeped into it. It's already out of commission for now.
>rempa

>calm

>run
Hero's Shore

>caneo
The canoe sways alarmingly. Maybe it isn't the best vessel for crossing the river.
>hosre
You give a few Er-ohs, oh-ers, Or Ehs. You'll probably need to say or do something entirely different to cross the river. There's the raft--those boats.
>heor
You give an Er-oh, oh-er, or Eh. You'll probably need to say or do something entirely different to cross the river. There's the raft--those boats.
>soka
No, best concentrate on what the raft is.
>oka
No, best concentrate on what the raft is.
>fihs
T'fish won't shift nowt.
>herrign
Nothing doing. It is, after all, a RED herring. Ba dum bum.
>sculptuer
That sculpture is pretty firm and stuck as-is. Better to go off and do something cooler than Shoer Osher ever got credit for.
>cutl
That sculpture is pretty firm and stuck as-is. Better to go off and do something cooler than Shoer Osher ever got credit for.
>supre
That sculpture is pretty firm and stuck as-is. Better to go off and do something cooler than Shoer Osher ever got credit for.
>rivre
That would cause serious injury to people and property, even if it could work.
>rivear
That would cause serious injury to people and property, even if it could work.
>ora
If you looked at just one oar, the raft would do no better than go in circles.
>bota
No one boat seems better than the others. Maybe you should widen your focus to all the boats.
>interlockign
Whoah, they're just oars. Think simpler. Much simpler.

>bota
No one boat seems better than the others. Maybe you should widen your focus to all the boats.
>boast

>freigth
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
>crasy
No way. You're not changing the crays--and if you changed one, the others would get you. You need a way out.
>crya
No way. You're not changing the crays--and if you changed one, the others would get you. You need a way out.
>leap
Anger Range

>angre
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.

>piek
You need to deal with all the bullies at once, somehow, not just one at a time.
>capr
You need to deal with all the bullies at once, somehow, not just one at a time.
>tutro
Deal with the attackers, not the trout

>spike

>undo
>scrap

>scralw
It's probably not just any scrawl. What the scrawl says may be important.

>hauntre
You need an organized way to see what's under the ground, and you don't have a digging instrument, either.

>e
Lean Lane
>lena
You would upset countless people named Lena or Neal.
>cna
Getting rid of one can would still leave a mess. Maybe you can deal with them all.
>casn
You glance at your settler, wondering what to do with the cans. Maybe you've overlooked something obvious.
>eke
You try to eke out an eek, but you only have one data point, and that's not enough.

>scan

Handsome Sand Home

>handsoem
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
>hoem
You should never need to riff on part of a location name, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so if you're observant, so that's one less thing to worry about, I hope.
>sadn
You should never need to riff on part of a location name, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so if you're observant.
>rewadr
Aunt Tuna would probably open the drawer if you helped poor Tortu the Trout.

>tutro
You try to describe how to fight, but that's not it.

>tutor
>rewadr
There's nothing else in the drawer and no way to get in by yourself.

>bubbel
It's just wrap, really.
>bubblewrpa
It's just wrap, really.
>detn
That's not the way to futz with the dent, though it felt good to grunt while saying it. Or thinking it.
>tend
>detn
You already fixed the dent. It's gone
>tuan
She is a bit fussy, but she is more than okay as she is.
>tae
Quit playing with your food, already.

>trya
Best to think of it as just tea.
>teatrya
Best to think of it as just tea.
>wiep
It'd be easier to steal all the wipes at once. Pulling them out and so forth--tiring.
>swipe

>wiep
It'd be easier to use them all at once. Pulling them out and so forth--tiring.

>tutor
Retutor? Torture. Rot. True!

>tutro
Retutor? Torture. Rot. True!

>eat
>bubbel

It's just wrap, really.

>pealr
The pearl is too jagged to change easily, but it seems like it was roughly cut in half. Maybe if you find the other bit...

>swipe
>w

>plani
"I...plan," you think, then in a fit of confidence, "I...PLANS!"
>splani
You feel like making a big speech about what you've done and what you plan to do, but not quite like that.
>splain
>splani
You had your say.
>plani
You had your say.

>actesr
Hmm, no, it's only one crate at a time...

>fragmenst
They're fragments of a crate--this may or may not help.
>fragmetn
They're fragments of a crate--this may or may not help.

>traec
The crate's from there! No, there! No, there! Well, you thought you had an idea, but it was a bit jumbled.
>trace
by one point
>traec
The crates that missed you wobble a bit. You know what'll happen, just not what to do...quite yet.
>react

>traec
Besides identifying it as a rect, you can't do much else with the crate.

>fragmenst
Not worth messing with the fragments any more.
>fragmetn
Not worth messing with the fragments any more.

>actesr
Hmm, no, it was only one crate at a time...

Those skis block the door pretty handily.

You are probably over-thinking it. There's a more direct way to tackle the rude door.
>messaeg

>intheer
The words on the door don't change. They are just a generic taunt.
>iks
But you need to remove both skis.
>sksi

"NOPE, PEON!" the rude door booms, somehow. The knob seems stuck.

>redu

>undo

You already opened the door

>doorknbo
It's just a knob. Which thankfully cuts down the possibilities.

>debrsi
You can't learn much from the debris. You're pretty sure it's from a crate.
>shtu
The huts are too secure, but maybe you can go by the door.
>intheer
The words on the door don't change. They are just a generic taunt.
>bokn
You should leave the knob to b'n OK.

>in

>ahtu

>utb

>sbtu
Hm. The tubs rattle a bit, but you need to do something strong.

>bust

The tubs already got broken up.

>sweta
The heaps are still technically waste, but you may want to deal with them more delicately

>shape

>sweat

>sweta

>drpo
You juggle the prod a bit, but it doesn't change into anything. Well, not like that.
>lanec
The lance is still itself--you can't figure how to apply the wipes.

>abstract wipes to ll
>lanec

>purloin wipes

>reacsh
Hm, you almost thought you found something. Well, not QUITE like that.

>hedrno
You'll probably need to destroy the hedron from within.
>arhc
There's not just one arch, there's two. And they've made more than one person ache.
>sardien
The sardine gives you a weird look, as if you need to stop mumbling. You're not sure you can do anything to him directly.

>warp
>search

>achre
You already dealt with both arches--no need to deal with one.

>reacsh
Further searching proves fruitless.

Horned Hedron

>hedrno
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
>thesse
The hedron's spirit will remain intact even if you meddle there. You must go into its heart.
>thees
It'd be fun to rip up even one, but it'd be worse if you got caught. Take down the hedron, instead.
>tapr
You think of changing the trap--maybe even a tarp! But maybe the trap IS a tarp that enfolds you. Scary. No, thinking of it as an ol' trap would make it less intimidating.
>walleey
Just tacking one walleye won't change the crowd. They're past redemption, anyway.
>walleyse
The walleyes are a bad crowd, past redemption.

No, that's not quite it. The ruby dulls as if covered by dirt.

Don't oversell it! Just take the haunter to where it was probably (heh) the walleyes who buried the ruby.

It's the words on the jumble you need to mess with. With which you need to mess. Well, once the yapper's out of the way.
