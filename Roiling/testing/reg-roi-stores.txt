#nudge for storea
>storea
Nothing happens. You'd think that store would be a good candidate to change, but it isn't

#nudge for storec
>storec
Nothing happens. You'd think that store would be a good candidate to change, but it isn't

#nudge for stored
>stored
Nothing happens. You'd think that store would be a good candidate to change, but it isn't

#nudge for storee

Nothing happens. You'd think that store would be a good candidate to change, but it isn't

#nudge for storeg

#nudge for stores
>stores
Nothing happens. You'd think that store would be a good candidate to change, but it isn't


#nudge for storef
>storef
That was soooo last game! Not that Shuffling Around was lame. I mean, I wrote it, and all. Just, I got even better at writing since then, and I wrote in newer awesomer adventures!

#nudge for storei
>storei
That was soooo last game! Not that Shuffling Around was lame. I mean, I wrote it, and all. Just, I got even better at writing since then, and I wrote in newer awesomer adventures!

#nudge for storem
>storem

#nudge for storej
>storej
Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway

#nudge for storex
>storex
Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway

#nudge for storez
>storez
Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway

#nudge for windows
>wowdins
Sadly, trying to change the windows wouldn't actually change the stores enough to find somewhere new.

#nudge for window
>wowdin
Sadly, trying to change the windows wouldn't actually change the stores enough to find somewhere new.

>ethros
Store H looks totally different for a second.

#nudge for shells
>shells
The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue.

#nudge for shell
>shlel
The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue.

#nudge for store
>estro
You'll want to focus on a specific store.

#nudge for montage
>egmaton
It's probably counterproductive to change--it's more an information booth.

#nudge for storel
>olster
You search for a magic word but feel, er, lost.

>trekos
An odd sweet smell from Store K, for a second.

>tokers

#nudge for toker
>treko
They already lost one of their collective, man. It'd be a bummer

>trekos
They are who they are. You should maybe try to get their friend back.

>routes
>troves

#nudge for route
>utreo
You don't need to do anything with an individual route. Just go in.

#nudge for trove
>otver
No need to focus on a specific trove. Just enter or take the troves.

>otvers
You've got an entry. No need to seal it up.

#nudge for storeo
>sooter
Nothing happens. You consider going through the other 358 possibilities, but that'd be so rote.

#nudge for storeq
>sqerto
Nothing happens. You didn't really expect it to since, hey, no u with the q.

#nudge for storer
>strore
Store R led back to your manor last game. It won't go anywhere new, and you don't need or want to go back, right now. You wouldn't be safe there.

#nudge for someone
>someoen
Nothing happens. You probably need to worry about the stores and/or what they become, instead.

#nudge for nouned
>nouned
Nothing happens. You probably need to worry about the stores and/or what they become, instead.

#nudge for ivy
viy
!What the towers are made of is not important

>towers

#dupnudge for ivy
>ivy
What the towers are made of is not important. Just that they're big, and there's a quest behind them

#nudge for ivory
>ivory
What the towers are made of is not important. Just that they're big, and there's a quest behind them

#nudge for ivytower
>ivytower
What the towers are made of is not important. Just that they're big, and there's a quest behind them
#nudge for ivorytower
>ivorytower
What the towers are made of is not important. Just that they're big, and there's a quest behind them

#nudge for tower
>tower
What the towers are made of is not important. Just that they're big, and there's a quest behind them

>otters

#nudge for otter
>otter
You can't divide and conquer, and the otters won't let you by unless you're, well, ready.

>presto

#nudge for spot
>spto
You can't, er, stop the, er, spot. Best to go in.

#nudge for engraving
>engravign
The engraving is meant to be read. You can modify it with other actions.

#nudge for engravings
>engravinsg
You can only change the enrgavings by working through the other stores.

>purloin patcher
#nudge for patcher
>ptacher
The patcher doesn't need to be changed. It does the changing if you point it.

>x otters

#nudge for field
>ifdel
You're not near enough to the barley to affect it. You need to ENTER through the otters

#nudge for barley
>belray
You're not near enough to the barley to affect it. You need to ENTER through the otters.

>barley
You're not near enough to the barley to affect it. You need to ENTER through the otters. Still, that seems right, if you get there.

>nestor

#nudge for smoke
>smeko
It's just smoke. You can't control it. Heck, governments more powerful than you can't control it, and they've been trying. But you can maybe enter it.

#nudge for cloud
>cludo
It's just smoke. You can't control it. Heck, governments more powerful than you can't control it, and they've been trying. But you can maybe enter it.

#nudge for smokecloud
>smekocludo

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

#nudge for profit
>profit
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

#nudge for profits
>profits
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

>enter cloud
Cruelest Lectures

#nudge for highway
>highwya
You can't see the way high highway any more, and you'd rather deal with the lecturer. Tedious.

#nudge for seats
>estas
That might cause a bit too much commotion. Maybe you can just get rid of the lecturer, pay attention to your feelings, and maybe even Ian.

#nudge for example
>exampel
The lecturer is unchangeable in his views, but maybe he is physically moveable.

#nudge for lecture
>lectuer
The lecturer is unchangeable in his views, but maybe he is physically moveable.

#nudge for lectures
>lectuers
The lecturer is unchangeable in his views, but maybe he is physically moveable.

>nia
Ian's had a big life change

>ani
Ian's had a big life change

#nudge for ian
>ina
Ian is unchangeable, but maybe he is moveable.

#nudge for guardian
>guardina
Ian is unchangeable, but maybe he is moveable.

#nudge for heartfelt
>heartfetl
You're probably overthinking it. The I-USED-TO examples are just plain tedious.

#nudge for reflections
>reflectiosn
You're probably overthinking it. The I-USED-TO examples are just plain tedious.
