>storea
Nothing happens. You'd think that store would be a good candidate to change, but it isn't
>storec
Nothing happens. You'd think that store would be a good candidate to change, but it isn't
>stored
Nothing happens. You'd think that store would be a good candidate to change, but it isn't

>storef
That was soooo last game! Not that Shuffling Around was lame. I mean, I wrote it, and all. Just, I got even better at writing since then, and I wrote in newer awesomer adventures!
>storei

>storej
Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway
>storex
Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway
>storez
Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway

>wowdins
Sadly, trying to change the windows wouldn't actually change the stores enough to find somewhere new.
>wowdin

>ethros
Store H looks totally different for a second.

>shells
The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue.

>shlel
The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue.

>estro
You'll want to focus on a specific store.

>egmaton
It's probably counterproductive to change--it's more an information booth.

>olster
You search for a magic word but feel, er, lost.

>trekos
An odd sweet smell from Store K, for a second.

>tokers

>treko
They already lost one of their collective, man. It'd be a bummer

>trekos
They are who they are. You should maybe try to get their friend back.

>routes
>troves

>utreo
You don't need to do anything with an individual route. Just go in.

>otver
No need to focus on a specific trove. Just enter or take the troves.

>otvers
You've got an entry. No need to seal it up.

>sooter
Nothing happens. You consider going through the other 358 possibilities, but that'd be so rote.

>sqerto
Nothing happens. You didn't really expect it to since, hey, no u with the q.

>strore
Store R led back to your manor last game. It won't go anywhere new, and you don't need or want to go back, right now. You wouldn't be safe there.

>someoen
>nouned

>towers

>ivy
What the towers are made of is not important. Just that they're big, and there's a quest behind them
>ivory

>ivytower

>otters
>irdan
Darin and Randi, the otters, don't move. You feel a nadir, a drain, even trying to manipulate them.

>otter
You can't divide and conquer, and the otters won't let you by unless you're, well, ready.

>presto
>spto
You can't, er, stop the, er, spot. Best to go in.

>engravign
The engraving is meant to be read. You can modify it with other actions.

>engravinsg
You can only change the enrgavings by working through the other stores.

>purloin patcher
>ptacher
The patcher doesn't need to be changed. It does the changing if you point it.

>x otters
>ifdel
You're not near enough to the barley to affect it. You need to ENTER through the otters

>belray
You're not near enough to the barley to affect it. You need to ENTER through the otters. 

>barley
You're not near enough to the barley to affect it. You need to ENTER through the otters. Still, that seems right, if you get there.

>nestor
>smeko
It's just smoke. You can't control it. Heck, governments more powerful than you can't control it, and they've been trying. But you can maybe enter it.
>cludo
It's just smoke. You can't control it. Heck, governments more powerful than you can't control it, and they've been trying. But you can maybe enter it.
>smekocludo

>strip
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game
>profit
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game
>profits
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

>enter cloud
Cruelest Lectures

>highwya
You can't see the way high highway any more, and you'd rather deal with the lecturer. Tedious.

>estas
That might cause a bit too much commotion. Maybe you can just get rid of the lecturer, pay attention to your feelings, and maybe even Ian.

>exampel
The lecturer is unchangeable in his views, but maybe he is physically moveable.
>lectuer
The lecturer is unchangeable in his views, but maybe he is physically moveable.
>lectuers
The lecturer is unchangeable in his views, but maybe he is physically moveable.
>nia
Ian's had a big life change
>ani
Ian's had a big life change
>ina
Ian is unchangeable, but maybe he is moveable.

>guardina
Ian is unchangeable, but maybe he is moveable.

>heartfetl
You're probably overthinking it. The I-USED-TO examples are just plain tedious.
>reflectiosn
