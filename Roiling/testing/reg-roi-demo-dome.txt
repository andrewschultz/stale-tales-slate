Are you sure you want to leave before looking at everything?

>blather
There's nothing too tricky to do in the Demo Dome. You can THINK or request the SCORE to see if there's anything you missed. VERBS has limited utility, since there are no puzzles here.

It was tested to make sure even you couldn't magic it open.

Museums are designed to be impassive and impermeable, for the most part. This is full of exhibits--your questing days are over.

You read some more of the allow-lots-tools wall. Some of this might be useful if you make your own game. But not a lot.

Maybe in another game, you could do that, if you walked around right. But not this one.

Another thought reads: Finally, I'm just grateful I had so much fun exploring so many alleys and polishing so many odd things. I hope you had even half as much fun playing as I did writing the Stale Tales Slate.

That's the end of the Chronicle. You can read it again, if you want.

>icch
You can't change the book's writing. Well, you could, I guess. But this is a museum!

>edns
You suddenly feel a desire to play an entirely different Andrew Schultz game. But you don't know which one!

Evoc-Cove
A welcoming place full of feeling and peace and weird new ideas that it's just good to know are there. A novella is propped up against the wall by some invisible force. You can go back west if you want.

>neva
>lol
Yeah, the novel is pretty unbelievable, but it's not there to be profound.

Bulk-Klub's credibility took a hit once Elvira got on their board of directors, and it may need some fundamental reorganization, but you vowed to use your wits and not your wordplay power for that.

>score
It looks like you've looked through everything. Thanks for all the time you spent, and I hope it was worth it!
