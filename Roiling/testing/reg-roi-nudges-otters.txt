Tapering Anger Pit
This north-south passage is frustratingly blocked.

A sly imp simply zooms about rangily guarding the way north, with a butlery air, showing legendary patience that allows vaster averts.

Ed Riley acts as a steward here to keep you eastward. He is carrying an ER, YIELD sign and a loaf of deli rye.

Slowly, conversation dwindles until it leaves every hassler rahless, slasher of noise. They find another place where rioters roister.

As they sulk away from the anteroom, they whimper about that bum Ed Riley who got a more exciting post than they did despite his moving so weedily. You're a bit sad you couldn't dispatch that loudmouth yet, but yay, working your enemies against each other.

"I will not re-yield! I am no longer a yielder! Ye Idler!" booms Ed Riley, and then he bangs on about not trying to sing or attack him.

He's not bigger than you, but his loud voice scares you. And he could probably swat you with either that deli rye or er, yield sign. You back away.

>x yield
"Spiffy, huh? I was told I could wipe off the "er" for the first person I scared into not passing me for good."

Gent-Fora Frontage

>bulwark
The whole bulwark? No, you couldn't do much with it at full strength

>despairingly
The macks become upset Gretta does not recognize just how swell they are--as a group, and individually. Gretta shrugs and shakes her head, maybe more at herself than the macks.

>drawlingly
The macks begin talking slower, and suddenly, their conversational hold is broken. Gretta realizes there's no good way to make home repair discussions more exciting and says so. She looks relieved.

Modesty is a good thing--well, in the long term. In the short term, the macks' backtracking is too brazen, and it ruins any hope of impressing anyone with false humility or braggadocio.

You can't change Merle and Elmer, but maybe you could find a way to get rid of them.

>honestly
You entrench an enchanter with a well-timed "Honestly?" They throw out anti lying litanying but you're all "Few LOLs, fellows." It's not pretty, but their camaraderie's shattered. They begin squabbling about whom Elvira likes better. It's a welcome change.

>hylontes
Neither Merle nor Elmer is going to be any more honest. Or anything nice or good, really.

>discern
(taking the cinders first)
You feel sort of clever finding what to do with the cinders, but maybe you can be even cleverer, if you're a perfectionist and all. Discern anyway?
As you gaze into the cinders, they glint slightly off the medals, leaving you feeling the medals need refurbishing. Maybe in the areas north and south of the barley.

Your medals clink as you go west. Elvira hears them and ambushes you! She touches what you recognize as the Ultimate Mutilate-It Amulet and fires the legendary Phrase Shaper Phaser at you. You think of possible replies, of ways to block her, as you slump to the ground. But you are not fast enough. The last thing you hear as you slump to the ground is Gretta's medals clanking--the ones you never quite used, though you sort of figured how, earlier.
