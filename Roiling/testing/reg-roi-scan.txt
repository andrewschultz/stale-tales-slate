You look at your settler and realize you haven't really EXAMINED it. Maybe you should, before going out in the world. You've been able to guess what to do so far, with the help of heuristics and generally knowing what's in a house, but you may need technical help you can rely on when you hit less friendly areas.

Elmo might shoot you if you went for the settler, which you notice is blinking RRYYR. Which has to be the rifle. You hope.

Your settler registers ??R?--hmm. Some of the spaces are blinking as if the settler couldn't tell what letters should be used. Maybe there are two ways to wangle things, or maybe the ambiguity is an extra clue. You could try re-scanning in non-cheat mode.
