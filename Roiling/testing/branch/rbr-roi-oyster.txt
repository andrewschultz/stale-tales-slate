If the Horned Hedron could be undermined or infiltrated, perhaps things would get back to normal. And perhaps the haunter could be used against them. It hates them.

You look at the pins. They're in the way, but they don't look particularly sturdy.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the pins. That's a decent omen.

You don't have anything with a small enough blade to cut the pins. And even then, they'd still be in the way of operating the dial again. But that has to be close to what you need to do.

This will cause Elvira to (mistakenly) destroy the Horned Hedron, but there is even more action here. Stay back and clean up everything?

Luckily, you find an evac-cave that lets you out safely. You decide to beat feet to the Anger Range.
Casper Spacer himself shakes your hand. "No hunter! On the run! None hurt!" He had gotten enough gritty writing from when the Horned Hedron still exerted its hold, but after a brief interview with you, now he has a story about--well, someone like you, with fewer faults, but more a tragic hero. He calls for his adventurer friend Red Gil. "Get this hero a glider girdle!" You learn it easily. Casper is even more impressed. You fly back to the Strip of Profits.
