The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: one final word will work here, to make things as they should be. It is eleven letters long, but everything else is shorter--most are from six to eight letters, though optional ones may be from five to nine.
!Hmm...that's good practice, and a good guess, but even if it were right, you don't know if you could change the curst palace from here.
