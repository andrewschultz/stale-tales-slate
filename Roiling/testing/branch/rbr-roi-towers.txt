#pre-rodney rule

Your attempt to bounce Rodney yonder is blocked by a few of his followers, who stumble a bit but stay upright as they combat the invisible force sucking him away. That looked like the right idea, but maybe get rid of a few of them, first?

The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: one word will work here, to make things as they should be. The final word is eleven letters long, but everything else is shorter--one necessary word has nine, as does another optional one, and a few have eight.
!Hmm...that's good practice, and a good guess, but even if it were right, you don't know if you could change the curst palace from here.

You think you see how to untangle some of the mess inside the/a bot-boat, but you don't want or need to do anything unless it's all just right.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the weirder red wire. That's a decent omen.

Hm, looks like the red wire doesn't make you SEE red. You were never an electrical whiz, but maybe general logic will help rearrange the tangled connections.

The serpent remains kinda chaotic evil looking, and not just because it can't understand English. You see red at using a verb and not an adjective.

You're not sure if the serpent's ever been spent, so you can't quite make it re-spent. You feel you have to be close, though.

#scannotes for nastier stainer retinas

Boy! Over half the readings are ambiguous! Nastier than usual, indeed. Though actually, if they were only "stainer retinas," you'd have one-half the possibilities. Sometimes evil is like that. The more evil it is, the more intimidating it seems, but the more it can leave itself vulnerable to good guys just plodding away.
