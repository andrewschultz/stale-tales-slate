#pre-rodney rule
>yonder
Your attempt to bounce Rodney yonder is blocked by a few of his followers, who stumble a bit but stay upright as they combat the invisible force sucking him away. That looked like the right idea, but maybe get rid of a few of them, first?
!by one point
#preefcheck rodney
>pf
Rodney can be sent YONDER once he's lost enough followers.
>droney
Rodney's voice would certainly seem droney by itself, but he segues into a marching song. I guess when you're a leader, you have that confidence. Maybe diminish his forces?

The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: one word will work here, to make things as they should be. The final word is eleven letters long, but everything else is shorter--one necessary word has nine, as does another optional one, and a few have eight.
!Hmm...that's good practice, and a good guess, but even if it were right, you don't know if you could change the curst palace from here.

You helped St. Teri directly. Now you need to deal with the Done-Any Anodyne.
#this is a weird case. It's not the anodyne that's being rejected as much as the itster, which has now vanished and createe the Done-Any Anodyne upon fliptoing

You blink a bit. You wonder if this would be the best way to use your x-ray vision. Do so anyway?
>y
After a thoughtful gaze, you reckon the Done-Any Anodyne could leave St. Teri ANNOYED.

Your settler begins to make noises: a low hum, but nothing really piercing.

St. Teri seems interested, but her hands reflexively grasp the Done-Any Anodyne. How could you dispose of it?

The entire settler lights up, finally!
Your settler registers RRYR?YRYRY?.
The final entry blinks alternately with the fifth--neither is purple at the same time. The settler usually isn't this slow, but maybe you can take advantage of it having so much data to process
!Sadly, the ambiguous fifth entry doesn't seem like you could figure it easily, even if you had a full report from the settler

There's no time for food! Especially fatty, non-brain food! Besides, the towers had plenty of food. There was your chance!

#### bug with GO TO DUCK printing the wrong error but only if I skip the Trefoil. Is there any way...?
