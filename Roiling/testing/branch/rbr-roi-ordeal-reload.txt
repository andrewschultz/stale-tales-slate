There's no need to tidy your study up just now. Still, that seems right, so you file that idea away for later.
In fact, you realize the notepad on the chair would be a great place to file that idea. It'll help tame lots that's meta, mate.

###################let's just get this error out of the way!
>event mpa
The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works, though some of the diorama's contrived examples have spaces.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: You need to change certain things to other things.

Your settler throws out a bunch of beeps:  HIGH LOW LOW HIGH LOW HIGH LOW LOW.
Ugh. Those high notes gave you a migraine mini-rage. You switch off the slider.
You figure you can take that noise nine more times.
Since the diorama has instructions on what changes to what, and it is only a teaching instrument, you probably don't want to use up any more slider charges on any part of it.

"Oh. One more thing. Instead of the scepter you could've had, have Inducted Deductin'. It's got examples of how to use the settler. Just in case you need to brush up. It might spoil too much. So you can DROP it. But if you want it, here it is."

"Well done." A scepter appears in the Respect Specter's hands before disappearing with a pop. "Oops, forgot to warn you, it wasn't real. But it wouldn't have been useful. Besides, the real treasure is the puzzles you solved along the way. I hope scanning me both ways revealed that cheat mode has some limitations, and non-cheat may reveal ambiguous readings from cheat mode."

"In this case, the two vowels must be in slots 3, 5 and 6, so you can just try putting the only possible consonant in 3, then in 5, then in 6."

"I can't tell you the full solution, but you may also note that slot 1 and 7 both possibly being R can cut down the possibilities, too. You may need guesswork at the end if you can't see the word, but there are less possibilities than you think. In this case, you may stumble across the answer, so I can't say anything specific."

"This example was sort of formulated. It may be easy to guess. You may also be able to assume you can't have three or four consonants in a row, which can help. But I'm here just to show all the future possibilities."

The Poison Stripe surrounding the Same Mesa has caused people there to lose all sense of direction, physically and mentally. If one person could escape, that would change. The Oopsin' Priest may be able to help you.

Spoiloplis was founded on self-help books, pyramid schemes, and other shady industries. Mayor Irv Lea lauds it as a center of positive thought. And not the nerdy brainy thought that goes into anagrams. You probably can't meet him, but maybe you can upset the social order.
>xg 3
There is rumor of a Hacks' Shack immune to Elvira's SHATTER-THREATS legislation behind a near-nonsensical maze that may have you saying or thinking impolite words. In that Hacks' Shack, you may feel a sense of normality that gets you back to how things were before Elvira.

A seashore seahorse mentioned subsea abuses you need freaky fakery to avoid. Something about a hideout, and a gang called DIE THOU. Vigorous action is necessary, and a lot of it.

The Wildest Wilteds are not to be traversed lightly. People protecting their territory just because. Bandits sacking taverns for no reason. The Curst Palace lies there, at the other side of Leak Lake. Condemned to be torn down to make a new MoneyCo office. Tax-free and all. Oh, and luxury condos endorsed by Avrile, that lifestyle maven. But if you could restore the palace somehow...

Little is known about the region beyond Store T except that an Or-Not-O-Tron dissuades people from paying it much attention. It must be important!
