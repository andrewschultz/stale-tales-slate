#renudge for storer
>storre
The resort and Store R led to the Means Manse last game. It won't go anywhere new, and you don't need or want to go back, right now. You wouldn't be safe there.
#nudge for strip
>strpi
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#nudge for profits

It's probably counterproductive to change--it's more an information booth.
>x montage
Also, the montage was created by Tom Egan. Of course. Can't say he was not game.
>x montage
!Also, the montage was created by Tom Egan. Of course. Can't say he was not game.
#nudge for engraving

The engraving is meant to be read. You can modify it with other actions.
#nudge for engravings

You can only change the enrgavings by working through the other stores.

Sadly, trying to change the windows wouldn't actually change the stores enough to find somewhere new.

#mistake test for ergots

You're trying to rescue the people of Yorpwald, not give them fungus infections.
#mistake test for gorest/go rest
>gorest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
>go rest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
#mistake test for gots er
>gots er
And what would you do with Store G, when you take it?
#mistake test for hoster

That was sort of a given from the warning on Store H, and it is all in red. So none of those letters are in place. Hmm, what's a place/person that's been isolated?
>x store h
###skip test checking

That was sort of a given from the warning on Store H, as you note E. S. Roth's signature, and it is all in red. So none of those letters are in place. Hmm, what's a place/person that's been isolated?
#mistake test for ektor/ektors

There's only one Ektor Mastiff, and to find him, you'd need to visit Marco Innocenti's most un-cyanotic Andromeda Collection.
>ektors

#mistake test for ouster
>ouster
It's your job to be the ouster in Store U, but you'll need to warp out of the Strip.
#mistake test for pteros
>pteros
You don't need to face any predators. Aigh!
#mistake test for repost
>repost
That's not what you need to do with Store P--you even see red trying to figure HOW you would.
#mistake test for resort
>resort
You can't go back to the Means Manse. Well, you can, but it's a bad idea.
#mistake test for restow
>restow
Store W glows red as you try this.
#mistake test for sportif
>sportif
You can argue whether the strip is already sportif, but nonetheless, that would be a superficial change compared to fixing what's behind the stores.
#mistake test for stoner
>stoner
"Hey, man! Don't depersonalize me! Or I'll throw something at you!" you hear from inside Store N.
>stoner
"Like, don't do it again, dude, or I will literally totally throw these empty bottles at you."
>stoner
The door to Store N opens, and two bottles whizz in your direction but nowhere close. They're bright red, and they appear to be lotions or something.
>stoner
You've teased the person in Store N enough. You should have enough clues to figure his name now, anyway.
#mistake test for storge
>storge
You have a momentary vision of an apocryphal eighth book in the Harry Potter series sitting by a pillar, but it passes.
>storge
Stop trying to make Pillar of Storge happen.
#mistake test for stroke
>stroke
You need a stroke of genius, but that's all wrong. You are left seeing red a bit. But this puzzle probably isn't worth risking your health over.
#mistake test for sureto/sure to
>sureto
You'll be sure to figure it out sooner or later. You see red a bit at not quite being there yet.
>sure to
You'll be sure to figure it out sooner or later. You see red a bit at not quite being there yet.
#mistake retest for throes
>throes
No, you are not in your last throes. Neither is Yorpwald. Try looking at stores at the other end of the alphabet.
#mistake test for tosher
>tosher
Insults will get you nowhere. You see red at thinking such a word.
#mistake test for toyers
>toyers
You see red at the possibility people might mess with your mind in whatever's behind store Y--especially after noting the TOYERS with the red line through in the window.
#mistake test for troyes
>troyes
Store Y does not lead to France.
#nudge for shell

The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue of what Store Y can become.
