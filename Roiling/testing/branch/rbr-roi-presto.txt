You also remember some mumbo-jumbo about the inclusion-exclusion principle, and how a random configuration of N items in a set has about a 1-1/e chance of having none right.

Hmm. Fixing code you've compiled is tricky. Once it's fixed, if you have even one thing in the wrong order, it does nothing right. That MUST be what's happening here, why BUB DUDE EGG is showing.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from BUB DUDE EGG. That's a decent omen.

Only one color for sure? And you don't even get any clues from BUB DUDE EGG? Well, perhaps there is some detective work here.

The process of debugging is going to take a while. You will need some sort of energy. That ALocalCo Cola won't quite be enough for the task ahead, as-is.

Wait. Maybe you don't need to scan anything with the settler. You remember you've already figured what to do, here, just not when. The information's in your pedanto-notepad.

The cola has already been reprocessed enough. You'll drink it when the time comes.

>pour cola in mug
You drain the ALocalCo cola bottle. It fills the mug, and you take a tiny sip. The liquid level refills after a minute. It tastes like car fuel, which makes you careful--and hopeful for a far clue. You feel more inspired and calmer than if you'd tried Loco-Alca or Loca-Alco, and your mind's clear enough, you finally see the right way to use a co-alloc. A recycling trap door makes a noise, and you pitch the empty cola bottle into it absent-mindedly.
The Be-Troo E-Robot, from under the labs slab, clicks reprovingly. Probably because it's a bot o' root beer.

You'd get cola all over you if you tried anything with the mug.

The mug is already somehow generating infinite cola. Don't want to mess with that.

You hear weird static from the settler. Perhaps there is more than one solution, and the settler is unable to determine which is more sensible.
