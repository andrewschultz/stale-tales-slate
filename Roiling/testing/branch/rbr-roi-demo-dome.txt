Many of the original testers of Shuffling Around have moved on. But thinking, yes, this is what they were REALLY asking for still helps me with the later releases. Or saying, yes, I know this puzzle isn't optimal, but I don't see how to fix it. Then years later seeing a way. Of course I want to move on. But it feels good to close the door on some issues, or know I can do better.
