You ponder the gropin' roping for a bit. You decide it isn't as worth thinking about as the Valence Enclave to the north.

You can't shake the fleeing feeling, and it's not just a general one. It says to you, PERP, PERP, PERP.

That's not the way to learn from the viewer--it's probably not that complicated. You hope.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the viewer. That's a decent omen.

It hurt to be called a perp. But maybe you can figure a way to spin that and heal the pain. Not quite like that, though.

# let's check "here/valence enclave" conditional text in the score
You have {SCORE} of {MAX} total points for the post-Elvira Others region, and you should be able to go north from here to the Valence Enclave to win.
You can't get the maximum score, since you used the arugula and missed a chance for something obscure with the sonic icons.
