Red? Dr. Tera Darter is nowhere NEAR that left-wing. Rat? Okay, she's probably big on government corruption, but--namecalling isn't the way to go, here.

Lola says nothing back.

You laugh at how silly Dr. Lola Ollard looks on the fake currency.

#spechelp for a brr hub
>rhubabr
The (a) brr hub seems to swirl closed for a bit.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the brr-hub. That's a decent omen.
#scannotes for a brr hub
>scan a brr hub
Wow, seven letters, odd. It must be *a* brr-hub. Maybe poking it would give another clue or so.
#spechelp for orange

The orange seems a bit closer for a bit.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the ENGARO orange. That's a decent omen.

The (a) banna' flutters about for a bit.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the banna'. That's a decent omen.
#scannotes for a banna

It must be the/a banna' AND the message on it.
#spechelp for Reserved Deserver Dr Severe
>reservde
You seem to see a mirror image of Dr. Severe for a moment.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Reserved Deserver Dr. Severe. That's a decent omen.
#scannotes for reserved deserver Dr Severe
>scan dr severe
Dr. Severe rolls his eyes. "My arguments certainly merit analysis, but there is no quick way to grokking them."
Whatever Dr. Severe rattles on about seems less important than how many letters are repeated, and that has to help cut down possibilities.
#nudge for brrhub
>brrhbu
It's a burr hub, not the burr hub. A small but important distinction.

@nud
#nudge for pace
>paec
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for severe

You need to change Dr. Severe, title and all.
