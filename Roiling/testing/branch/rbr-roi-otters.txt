#pre-whistle-deeply rule retry
>deeply
Elvira summons her monsters to attack as you learn to play the whistle. "Sorriest resistor! Apt end, pedant." is the last you hear. Maybe you should've practiced somewhere else.

You don't see anything happen. Then you note red writing on the whistle which might tell more about it.
#+ttc-table-of-otters-spechelp-weltish-whistle
>deepyl
The sound you make is experimental and groovy, in a new age jazz sort of way, but it's not quite right.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the weltish whistle. That's a decent omen.
>read whistle
Ed Plye, apparently, made the whistle.

You can't do much with Elvira's "real" name. Or her ex-hydra's. You need to act.
#+testcase-mistake-roiling-aliver
>aliver
For whatever reason, you decide to give Elvira even more power. This time, you don't have the time or guts to reject her phaser.
QUIT, or UNDO the last command.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-drop-it
>drop it
For whatever reason, you just decide to give up. Elvira cackles. "I knew you'd see it my way." You wind up apologizing on national TV for getting too big for your anagramming britches and accepting a general brainwashing to boot. It's not that bad, only because, well, um, it just isn't. You're thrown in a jail, which can't be anagrammed, but it's for your own good. You're cool with that.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-prod-it

You prod curiously at the machinery, and soon, Elvira realizes you don't have anything up your sleeve, and you won't be able to retreat in time. The purple pulper and the rest of her army subdue you easily.

The Rancho won't change to the river of the dead just like that, but on the other hand, if you wait around, you'll get to see the river of the dead once Elvira takes action.

It can't be as easy as changing the Rancho. Elvira wouldn't be so careless to allow THAT. You figure you probably need help.
