The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.

Even without the Edictal Citadel that way, Elvira wouldn't let you anywhere into her private chambers. Neither will her creations. Maybe you can sneak back east.

Elvira's laughter still seems to echo, with a creator reactor in the distance, and an occasional shrike shriek, and an ominous BEWARE: WAR BEE.

Elvira summons her monsters to attack as you learn to play the whistle. "Sorriest resistor! Apt end, pedant." is the last you hear. Maybe you should've practiced somewhere else.

The sound you make is experimental and groovy, in a new age jazz sort of way, but it's not quite right.

For whatever reason, you just decide to give up. Elvira cackles. "I knew you'd see it my way." You wind up apologizing on national TV for getting too big for your anagramming britches and accepting a general brainwashing to boot. It's not that bad, only because, well, um, it just isn't. You're thrown in a jail, which can't be anagrammed, but it's for your own good. You're cool with that.
