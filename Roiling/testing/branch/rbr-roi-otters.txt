The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: while some words are rather long, you probably see how to guess a letter or two even when you've got your powers back.
