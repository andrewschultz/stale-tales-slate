Posh Hops Shop

#nudge for storey
>storye
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

#nudge for posh
>pohs
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

#nudge for tine
>tien
Just one tine doesn't seem up to much.

#nudge for troll
>troll
Dealing with just one troll would cause the rest to call you a bully and beat you up. Gotta take 'em all, somehow.

#nudge for recap
>recpa
Casper glares at you, as if he knows you're thinking all his recaps are the same. No. You need to deal with them all.

#nudge for patrons
>patrosn
They would resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that.

#nudge for patron
>patrno
They would resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that.

#nudge for customer
>customre
They would resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that.

#nudge for customers
>customesr
They would resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that.

#nudge for tune
>tuen
Eh, you know how jukeboxes are. One tune quashed, another pops up. Get rid of 'em all.

#nudge for jar
>jra
You suspect it's what's in the jar that's important.

#nudge for spill
>splil
You seem to be fumbling what to do with the pills.

>snig
Hm, the sign doesn't strictly disallow THAT.

#nudge for tumbler
>tumblre
You can't pick out which tumbler to do something to. But you're annoyed by their tips, which make you see red.

#nudge for stumbler
>stumblre
Someone looks at you funny. "What are you muttering?" Maybe it's the writing on the tumblers, instead.

#nudge for jukebox
>jukebxo
You can't change the jukebox. The bad music has seeped into it. But maybe you can put it out of commission.

#nudge for remap
>rempa
You can't change the bad music selection. But you can neutralize it--the jukebox has instructions.

#nudge for unset
>unste
The tunes grow slightly less annoying, for a moment.

>unset

#dupnudge for unset
>unste
You can't change the bad music selection. You already got a temporary escape, and that should be good enough.

#dupnudge for jukebox
>jukebxo
You can't change the jukebox. The bad music has seeped into it. It's already out of commission for now.

#dupnudge for remap
>rempa
You can't change the bad music selection. You already got a temporary escape, and that should be good enough.

#dupnudge for unset
>unste
You can't change the bad music selection. You already got a temporary escape, and that should be good enough.

Olde Lode

#nudge for lode
>loed
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.

#nudge for calm
>calm

>run
Hero's Shore

#nudge for canoe
>caneo
The canoe sways alarmingly. Maybe it isn't the best vessel for crossing the river.

#nudge for hoser
>hosre
You give a few Er-ohs, oh-ers, Or Ehs. You'll probably need to say or do something entirely different to cross the river. There's the raft--those boats.

#nudge for hero
>heor
You give an Er-oh, oh-er, or Eh. You'll probably need to say or do something entirely different to cross the river. There's the raft--those boats.

#nudge for soak
>soka
No, best concentrate on what the raft is.

#nudge for oak
>oka
No, best concentrate on what the raft is.

#nudge for fish
>fihs
T'fish won't shift nowt.

#nudge for herring
>herrign
Nothing doing. It is, after all, a RED herring. Ba dum bum.

#nudge for sculpture
>sculptuer
That sculpture is pretty firm and stuck as-is. Better to go off and do something cooler than Shoer Osher ever got credit for.

#nudge for cult
>cutl
That sculpture is pretty firm and stuck as-is. Better to go off and do something cooler than Shoer Osher ever got credit for.

#nudge for super
>supre
That sculpture is pretty firm and stuck as-is. Better to go off and do something cooler than Shoer Osher ever got credit for.

#nudge for river
>rivre
That would cause serious injury to people and property, even if it could work.

#nudge for rivera
>rivear
That would cause serious injury to people and property, even if it could work.

#nudge for oar
>ora
If you looked at just one oar, the raft would do no better than go in circles.

#nudge for interlocking
>interlockign
Whoah, they're just oars. Think simpler. Much simpler.

#nudge for boat
>bota
No one boat seems better than the others. Maybe you should widen your focus to all the boats.
>boast

#nudge for freight
>freigth
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.

#nudge for crays
>crasy
No way. You're not changing the crays--and if you changed one, the others would get you. You need a way out.

#nudge for cray
>crya
No way. You're not changing the crays--and if you changed one, the others would get you. You need a way out.

#nudge for bota
>bato
Destroying the boat would be a bad idea. You need to escape it

#nudge for boats
>batos
Destroying the boat would be a bad idea. You need to escape it

>leap
Anger Range

#nudge for anger
>angre
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.

#nudge for pike
>piek
You need to deal with all the bullies at once, somehow, not just one at a time.
#nudge for carp
>capr
You need to deal with all the bullies at once, somehow, not just one at a time.
>tutro
Deal with the attackers, not the trout

>spike
by one point
>undo
>scrap

#nudge for scrawl
>scralw
It's probably not just any scrawl. What the scrawl says may be important.

#nudge for haunter
>hauntre
You need an organized way to see what's under the ground, and you don't have a digging instrument, either.

>e
Lean Lane
#nudge for lean
>lena
You would upset countless people named Lena or Neal.

#nudge for can
>cna
Getting rid of one can would still leave a mess. Maybe you can deal with them all.

#nudge for cans
>casn
You glance at your settler, wondering what to do with the cans. Maybe you've overlooked something obvious.

#nudge for eek
>eke
You try to eke out an eek, but you only have one data point, and that's not enough.

>scan
by one point

>seek
Helots' Hostel

#nudge for helots
>helost
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.

#nudge for helot
>helto
You should never need to riff on part of a location name, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so if you're observant, so that's one less thing to worry about, I hope.

#nudge for reward
>rewadr
Aunt Tuna would probably open the drawer if you helped poor Tortu the Trout.

>tutro
You try to describe how to fight, but that's not it.

>tutor

#dupnudge for reward
>rewadr
There's nothing else in the drawer and no way to get in by yourself.

#nudge for bubble
>bubbel
It's just wrap, really.

#nudge for bubblewrap
>bubblewrpa
It's just wrap, really.

#nudge for dent
>detn
That's not the way to futz with the dent, though it felt good to grunt while saying it. Or thinking it.

>tend
#dupnudge for dent
>detn
You already fixed the dent. It's gone

#nudge for tuna
>tuan
She is a bit fussy, but she is more than okay as she is.

#nudge for eat
>tae
Quit playing with your food, already.

#nudge for tray
>trya
Best to think of it as just tea.

#nudge for teatray
>teatrya
Best to think of it as just tea.

#nudge for wipe
>wiep
It'd be easier to steal all the wipes at once. Pulling them out and so forth--tiring.
>swipe

#dupnudge for wipe
>wiep
It'd be easier to use them all at once. Pulling them out and so forth--tiring.

>tutor
Retutor? Torture. Rot. True!

>tutro
Retutor? Torture. Rot. True!

>eat

#nudge for pearl
>pealr
The pearl is too jagged to change easily, but it seems like it was roughly cut in half. Maybe if you find the other bit...

>swipe
>w
>n

#nudge for plain
>plani
"I...plan," you think, then in a fit of confidence, "I...PLANS!"
>splani
You feel like making a big speech about what you've done and what you plan to do, but not quite like that.
>splain
>splani
You had your say.

#dupnudge for plain
>plani
You had your say.

#nudge for acters
>actesr
Hmm, no, it's only one crate at a time...

#nudge for fragments
>fragmenst
They're fragments of a crate--this may or may not help.

#nudge for fragment
>fragmetn
They're fragments of a crate--this may or may not help.

>traec
The crate's from there! No, there! No, there! Well, you thought you had an idea, but it was a bit jumbled.

>trace
by one point

>traec
The crates that missed you wobble a bit. You know what'll happen, just not what to do...quite yet.

>react
by one point

>traec
Besides identifying it as a rect, you can't do much else with the crate.

#dupnudge for acters
>actesr
Hmm, no, it was only one crate at a time...

#nudge for open
>opne
The words on the pans don't change. They are just a generic taunt.

#dupnudge for open
>open
WRONG The words on the pans don't change. They are just a generic taunt.

>bonk

#nudge for inthere
>intheer
The words on the door don't change. They are just a generic taunt.

#nudge for isk
>iks
But you need to remove both skis.
>sksi

>kiss

>x pans
"NOPE, PEON!"

>redu
It's not the rudeness of the door. More that knob is stuck.
>undo
>undo

>bonk

#nudge for doorknob
>doorknbo
It's just a knob. Which thankfully cuts down the possibilities.

#nudge for debris
>debrsi
You can't learn much from the debris. You're pretty sure it's from a crate.

#nudge for shut
>shtu
The huts are too secure, but maybe you can go by the door.

#nudge for hut
>htu
The huts are too secure, but maybe you can go by the door.

#dupnudge for inthere
>intheer
The words on the door don't change. They are just a generic taunt.

#nudge for bonk

You should leave the knob to b'n OK.

Shadier Airshed

#nudge for airshed

#nudge for ubt

#nudge for bust
>sbtu
Hm. The tubs rattle a bit, but you need to do something strong.

>bust
by one point

#dupnudge for bust
>sbtu
The tubs already got broken up.

>sweta
The heaps are still technically waste, but you may want to deal with them more delicately

#nudge for heap
>epha
Change ALL the heaps!

>shape

#dupnudge for heap
You don't need or want to futz with one heap to make things super-extra-perfect.

>sweat

>sweta
Your work turned up enough.

#nudge for drop
>drpo
You juggle the prod a bit, but it doesn't change into anything. Well, not like that.

#nudge for lance
>lanec
The lance is still itself--you can't figure how to apply the wipes.

>abstract wipes to ll

#dupnudge for lance
>lanec
--but how to make it neater, now.

>purloin wipes

>clean lance

#dupnudge for lance
>lanec
The lance is still itself--and you probably did enough cleaning it.

>drop prod

#nudge for digger
>diggre
It's what it needs to be, you imagine.

>out

#dupnudge for shut

#nudge for reachs
>reacsh
Hm, you almost thought you found something. Well, not QUITE like that.

#nudge for hedron
>hedrno
You'll probably need to destroy the hedron from within.

#nudge for arch
>arhc
There's not just one arch, there's two. And they've made more than one person ache.

#nudge for sardine
>sardien
The sardine gives you a weird look, as if you need to stop mumbling. You're not sure you can do anything to him directly.

>warp
>search

#nudge for acher
>achre
You already dealt with both arches--no need to deal with one.

#dupnudge for reachs
>reacsh
Further searching proves fruitless.

>n
Horned Hedron

#nudge for hedrno
>hedrno
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.

#nudge for theses
>thesse
The hedron's spirit will remain intact even if you meddle there. You must go into its heart.

#nudge for these
>thees
It'd be fun to rip up even one, but it'd be worse if you got caught. Take down the hedron, instead.

#nudge for tarp
>tapr
You think of changing the trap--maybe even a tarp! But maybe the trap IS a tarp that enfolds you. Scary. No, thinking of it as an ol' trap would make it less intimidating.

#nudge for walleye
>walleey
Just tacking one walleye won't change the crowd. They're past redemption, anyway.

#nudge for walleyes
>walleyse
The walleyes are a bad crowd, past redemption.

>w

#nudge for bury

No, that's not quite it. The ruby dulls as if covered by dirt.

 You need an organized way to see what's under the ground with your rigged digger.

The haunter needs to be dealt with otherwise.

#nudge for howler
>howlre
Anything can howl, but this is a haunter--and, in fact, it's not just a haunter but a SAUSAGE.

>assuaeg
You're a bit tongue-tied, but that seems close.
