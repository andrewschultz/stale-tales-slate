You try going north and looking for that poison stripe--but it's invisible and makes you wind up taking turns unconsciously. You arrive back at... the same mesa (thank you, I'm here all game,) from the south, after several minutes.

>u
That won't work right now.

>acros
Hm, it's Oscar'S.

>ascors
You twist and tilt your head but can't figure out how to interpret the regalia. But you must be close.

>dinyg
Perhaps it's better to focus on the proper names instead. Simpler, too

>dwellign
Perhaps it's better to focus on the proper names instead. Simpler, too

>sgin
It's what's on the board you need to fix.

>bodar
It's what's on the board you need to fix.

>signboadr
It's what's on the board you need to fix.

>strow
If you change the ad from the worst, maybe you won't make it better. Maybe you'll make something else even worse. So, focus on the whole.

>scripture
It's more likely that scripture can change you, or help you see something a bit simpler to say

>cripture
It's more likely that scripture can change you, or help you see something a bit simpler to say

>picture
It's more likely that scripture can change you, or help you see something a bit simpler to say

>pictures

>ames
Ames, Iowa is less nowhere than here for sure, regardless what some wiseguys from rival Big Twelve schools might say. But you can't just up and leave.

>esma
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>utreo
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

>utreos
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

>atsin
The church's name is not as important as its mission.

>edi
Nothing happens. You twiddle both words for a moment, then realize it's probably them, combined

>ins
Nothing happens. You twiddle both words for a moment, then realize it's probably them, combined

>insied
You feel you're not quite ready to enter the Cleric Circle, thinking like that. Well, not EXACTLY like that.

>tadrows
The ad seems slightly nearer, for a moment.

>inside

>ilst
Maybe you can use your powers to get what's on the list, but you don't need to use them on it.

>ostil
Maybe you can use your powers to get what's on the list, but you don't need to use them on it.

>x toils

>kyrise
They aren't there. And they wouldn't be changeable if they were.

>kyrei
They aren't there. And they wouldn't be changeable if they were.

>regenta
Maybe you can use your powers to get what's on the list, but you don't need to use them on it.

>rebroth
It's not Brother Horbert who needs changing but the Same Mesa.

>cicler

>pwes
No vandalizing church property.

>pwe
No vandalizing church property.

>letman
You can't change stuff like that by brute force. But you don't need to.

>man let
Your heart is in the right place, but telling the mantle to cool it won't do much good.

>out

>lairaeg
Lairage regalia is already tailored to the resident's style. So it's not yours to change, but maybe noting what's on it will help you get in.

>apt
That's not how to get into Pat'S, you reflect.

>regenta
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a general list of verbs, type VERBS, or for options, type OPTIONS.

>edi
The words themselves do nothing. You found the way in.

>ins
The words themselves do nothing. You found the way in.

>ptas
Concerned parents won't be able to help you here.

>psat
You have enough word juggling now. You don't need a standardized test, too.

>spat
Picking a fight--or spitting--is uncouth.

>spta
You struggle a bit. The signboard should be pretty simple, being PAT'S. It'll come to you.

>past
Idle Deli

>elid
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

The whole seed pit.

>seedipt
The seed pit seems to bubble slightly.

>despite

>reagenst
Brother Horbert will do his magic on the reagents at the right time.

>reagetn
Brother Horbert will do his magic on the reagents at the right time.

>pat
Pat doesn't need consolation for his lost business.

>pta
You don't need to attend any school board meetings.

>tap
You have Pat's attention, already.

>tpa
You don't need to do anything with Pat, especially now you got the mushrooms.

Instead of bending the spoon, use it to help your magic powers.

>estirp
The poison stripe is too incorporeal to do bend to your will.

>posoniestirp
The poison stripe is too incorporeal to do bend to your will.

>restauratn
Perhaps it's better to focus on the proper names instead. Simpler, too.

>across
up by one point
Adobe Abode

>trasyh
It's one solid ashtray. You try aha's to do something, but you wind up all, yah, rats. Maybe it's the pipe soot you want.

>atrasyh
It's one solid ashtray. You try aha's to do something, but you wind up all, yah, rats. Maybe it's the pipe soot you want.

>toos

The soot smells a bit stronger than before for a moment.

>ocras
You don't need to do anything with Oscar, but maybe you can sneak the pipe soot away.

>opposite

>out

>ocras
No, you found the way in, with the extra s.

>lairaeg
Lairage regalia is already tailored to the resident's style. So it's not yours to change, and you don't need to.

>pepsitoo
Brother Horbert probably knows what to do with that.

>agastni
You hang around the bench, hoping for something to happen, but nothing happens. Though it seems like it should.

>enchb
The bench is too sturdy. You can't do anything with it, but you may be able to do something with or around it.

>byburg
Perhaps it's better to focus on the proper names instead. Simpler, too.

>against
You hear a giant's footsteps in the distance--but your talk with Brother Horbert has helped you be fearless.

>against
!You hear a giant's footsteps in the distance--but your talk with Brother Horbert has helped you be fearless.

>beneath
Nice try, but

>oblew
You're nowhere close to the giant's elbow.

>astried
Oof! You fail to jump on the bench end. Try mixing things up from what you just did.

>astride

>eblow
You seem like you should be able to avoid the elbow, but you may need to mix things up a bit.

>eblows
Thankfully, the giant's only really swinging one elbow, so--less to deal with, yay?

>below

>urde
That's not quite the book's whole title.

>urden
The pages of Rude 'N Nuder flutter a bit.

>eblows
You already avoided both elbows when you avoided one.

>igtan
The giant is too old and set in his ways. You may just need to listen to him from one more angle.

>igtanold
The giant is too old and set in his ways. You may just need to listen to him from one more angle.

The thing remains motionless.

>thign
The thing remains motionless.

>fomr
The huge thing form rocks in the air, as if it's about to fall.

>gnash
You gnash your teeth a bit thinking about how threatening the form is. It is probably going to fall some time. Maybe you can get it over with.

>gnahs
It won't help to gnash your teeth about it. It's just--as a form, it doesn't make much sense, and maybe you can change that.

>from
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>armaad
They're too unruly and confused, and you probably need to get away from them, anyway.

>beneaht
The bean rolls back and forth a bit.

>bane

You aren't far enough along to, err, look along.
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]

>beneath

>underpssa
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>uns
You should never need to riff on part of a location name, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so if you're observant, so that's one less thing to worry about, I hope.

>aspred
#"so that's one less" is a 1-time thing
You should never need to riff on part of a location name, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so if you're observant.

>anglo
You think of No-Gal Logan, wondering how to find a way to him.

>derknass
The darkness has always been there and always will be. You need to find a way to say it was dark.

The darkness has always been there and always will be. You need to find a way to say it was dark.

>utlin
You feel it's ALMOST the right time for the darkness to lift.

>urdoan
The cracks almost seem to lead somewhere.

>around

>pyrite
The pyrites seem to glow, momentarily forming an arrow as if to say, get on with it and stop worrying about treasure. You do still need to nag ol' No-Gal Logan.

>pyrites
The pyrites seem to glow, momentarily forming an arrow as if to say, get on with it and stop worrying about treasure. You do still need to nag ol' No-Gal Logan.

>agnol
No, you were right before, there. You just need some help to make that magic word in your notepad work, now. Or maybe you don't!

>depref
>agnol
The un-road seems to lead somewhere, but you couldn't quite make it out like that.

>along
Ripe Pier

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

That may not help you through the mist. Maybe read the sign instead.

>ignsiper
That may not help you through the mist. Maybe read the sign instead.

>read sign
ABROAD
DA MIST

>imst
Nothing happens. Then you re-read the sign and, oh, it's DA MIST. You feel more familiar with it, and more confident it leads somewhere, thinking of it that way.

>amdist
Hmm, you almost see a way through the mist.

>aboadr
You plot a zigzag past the sign, but you don't have full confidence in it, yet.

The reef is not changed. Perhaps you can deal with what's on it.

>betrothe
Hm! If you managed to betrothe the two, maybe you could make them past. But that would be an unholy union.

>ebet
The beet shines a bit extra, as if to say, it's a NEW beet, darn it.

>orth
You can't change Thor. He's too big and strong. But maybe you can get by, somehow.

>ithwin
The ship controls seem to adjust themselves slightly, but not enough.
