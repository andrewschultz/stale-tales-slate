You hear loud footsteps and hide under the anti-sag sit-a-nag in fear. A giant walks by but can't see anyone and runs off, complaining how there's nobody to complain to. Maybe if you had a reason to talk to the giant, or a purpose here, you might listen a bit better. Maybe if you could find a way to visit the Cleric Circle and find inner peace.
