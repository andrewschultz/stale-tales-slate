* silliness

>take me
I'm the only one who gets to be self-referential, here. Got it? Good.

>xyzzy
That word is a mess and holds absolutely no power for you. Hopefully you'll find why soon enough.

>ts
>xyzzy
That word is a mess and holds absolutely no power for you. Trust me, I checked all the other twenty-nine combinations.

>jump
You try a jump but jam up. Boy, leaps lapse.

>x chair

>wave
A view! I wave!

>yux pad
The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.

>yux pad
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a general list of verbs, type VERBS, or for options, type OPTIONS. 

>wave pad
I understood the first word, but it can just stand on its own as a verb. If you were trying to do something tricky with it, you shouldn't need to. So just "wave" should work.

>inset abc
You may not be using an object in the game, and you may wish to inseRt, instead.

>inset abc into def
You may want to INSERT x in Y instead.

>purloin settler
>gonear sand home

>eat
by one point
