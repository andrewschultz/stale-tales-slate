You see red slightly as Marble Blamer Balmer fails to look away.
#readables for blamer balmer
>read blamer balmer
A stern looking fellow who is big on personal responsibility and as ubiquitous as the Sister Tressi Siters. His big competition is, of course, Mr. Beal. You can READ who created this marble.
The likeness was drawn up by Mr. Beal LeBram, whose signature is in red.

#spechelp for sister tressi siters

Sister Tressi seems a bit more upset than usual.
#scannotes for sister tressi siters
>scan sister tressi siters
Hmm. Sister Tressi seems to be glaring extra, as if the settler's ambiguous settings are what you get for cheating, and she also seems to be saying, well, if life isn't EXACTLY as you'd expect, maybe you'd better learn to think your way around it.
#scannotes for trance nectar
>scan trance nectar
Well of course the final challenge wouldn't have any positive IDs, and the two variable colors seem like a slap in the face. It's not even clear which is the vowel and which is the consonant! Maybe you could start with the first letter...
