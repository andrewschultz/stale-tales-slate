#mistake test for throes

Strip of Profits

No, you are not in your last throes. Neither is Yorpwald. Try thinking of a more common word.
#nudge for storer

The resort and Store R led to the Means Manse last game. It won't go anywhere new, and you don't need or want to go back, right now.
!You wouldn't be safe there.

#nudge for store

You'll want to focus on a specific store.
#nudge for storea

#nudge for storef

That was soooo last game! Not that Shuffling Around was lame. I mean, I wrote it, and all. Just, I got even better at writing since then, and I wrote in newer awesomer adventures!
#nudge for storei

#nudge for storej
>storje
Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway.
#nudge for storex
>storxe
Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway.
#nudge for storez

#nudge for storel
>storle
You search for a magic word but feel, er, lost.
#nudge for storeo
>storoe
Nothing happens. You consider going through the other 358 possibilities, but that'd be so rote.
#nudge for storeq
>storqe
Nothing happens. You didn't really expect it to since, hey, no u with the q.
#renudge for storer
>storre
The resort and Store R led to the Means Manse last game. It won't go anywhere new, and you don't need or want to go back, right now. You wouldn't be safe there.
#nudge for strip
>strpi
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#nudge for profits
>profist
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for profit
>profti
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for montage
>montaeg
It's probably counterproductive to change--it's more an information booth.
>x montage
Also, the montage was created by Tom Egan. Of course. Can't say he was not game.
>x montage
!Also, the montage was created by Tom Egan. Of course. Can't say he was not game.
#nudge for engraving
>engravign
The engraving is meant to be read. You can modify it with other actions.
#nudge for engravings
>engravinsg
You can only change the enrgavings by working through the other stores.
#nudge for patcher
>purloin patcher
>patchre
The patcher doesn't need to be changed. It does the changing if you point it.
>undo

#nudge for someone
>someoen
Nothing happens. The engravings on the montage stay as they are. You probably need to worry about the stores and/or what they become, instead.
#nudge for nouned

#nudge for window
>windwo
Sadly, trying to change the windows wouldn't actually change the stores enough to find somewhere new.
#nudge for windows
>windosw
Sadly, trying to change the windows wouldn't actually change the stores enough to find somewhere new.
#mistake test for ergots
>ergots
You're trying to rescue the people of Yorpwald, not give them fungus infections.
#mistake test for gorest/go rest
>gorest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
>go rest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
#mistake test for gots er
>gots er
And what would you do with Store G, when you take it?
#mistake test for hoster
>hoster
That was sort of a given from the warning on Store H, and it is all in red. So none of those letters are in place. Hmm, what's a place/person that's been isolated?
>x store h
###skip test checking
>hoster
That was sort of a given from the warning on Store H, as you note E. S. Roth's signature, and it is all in red. So none of those letters are in place. Hmm, what's a place/person that's been isolated?
#mistake test for ektor/ektors
>ektor
There is not any crossover with Marco Innocenti's Andromeda Collection here. I'd feel kind of cyanotic putting too much in.
>ektors

#mistake test for ouster
>ouster
It's your job to be the ouster in Store U, but you'll need to warp out of the Strip.
#mistake test for pteros
>pteros
You don't need to face any predators. Aigh!
#mistake test for repost
>repost
That's not what you need to do with Store P--you even see red trying to figure HOW you would.
#mistake test for resort
>resort
You can't go back to the Means Manse. Well, you can, but it's a bad idea.
#mistake test for restow
>restow
Store W glows red as you try this.
#mistake test for sportif
>sportif
You can argue whether the strip is already sportif, but nonetheless, that would be a superficial change compared to fixing what's behind the stores.
#mistake test for stoner
>stoner
"Hey, man! Don't depersonalize me! Or I'll throw something at you!" you hear from inside Store N.
>stoner
"Like, don't do it again, dude, or I will literally totally throw these empty bottles at you."
>stoner
The door to Store N opens, and two bottles whizz in your direction but nowhere close. They're bright red, and they appear to be lotions or something.
>stoner
You've teased the person in Store N enough. You should have enough clues to figure his name now, anyway.
#mistake test for storge
>storge
You have a momentary vision of an apocryphal eighth book in the Harry Potter series sitting by a pillar, but it passes.
>storge
Stop trying to make Pillar of Storge happen.
#mistake test for stroke
>stroke
You need a stroke of genius, but that's all wrong. You are left seeing red a bit. But this puzzle probably isn't worth risking your health over.
#mistake test for sureto or sure to
>sureto
You'll be sure to figure it out sooner or later. You see red a bit at not quite being there yet.
>sure to
You'll be sure to figure it out sooner or later. You see red a bit at not quite being there yet.
#mistake retest for throes
>throes
No, you are not in your last throes. Neither is Yorpwald. Try looking at stores at the other end of the alphabet.
#mistake test for tosher
>tosher
Insults will get you nowhere. You see red at thinking such a word.
#mistake test for toyers
>toyers
You see red at the possibility people might mess with your mind in whatever's behind store Y--especially after noting the TOYERS with the red line through in the window.
#mistake test for troyes
>troyes
Store Y does not lead to France.
#nudge for shell
>shell
The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue of what Store Y can become.
#nudge for shells
>shelsl
The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue of what Store Y can become.

#nudge for mangiets

You can't see the way high highway any more, and you'd rather deal with the lecturer. Tedious.
#spechelp for lecturer
