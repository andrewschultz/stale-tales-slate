#mistake test for throes
>rove over

No, you are not in your last throes. Neither is Yorpwald. Try thinking of a more common word.

@nud
#mistake test for ergots
>ergots
You're trying to rescue the people of Yorpwald, not give them fungus infections.
#mistake test for gorest/go rest
>gorest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
>go rest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
#mistake test for gots er
>gots er
And what would you do with Store G, when you take it?
#mistake test for hoster
>hoster
That was sort of a given from the warning on Store H, as you note E. S. Roth's signature, and it is all in red. So none of those letters are in place. Hmm, what's a place/person that's been isolated?
>x hoster

#mistake test for ouster
>ouster
It's your job to be the ouster in Store U, but you'll need to warp out of the Strip.
#mistake test for pteros
>pteros
You don't need to face any predators. Aigh!
#mistake test for repost
>repost
That's not what you need to do with Store P--you even see red trying to figure HOW you would.
#mistake test for resort
>resort
You can't go back to the Means Manse. Well, you can, but it's a bad idea.
#mistake test for restow
>restow
Store W glows red as you try this.
#mistake test for sportif
>sportif
You can argue whether the strip is already sportif, but nonetheless, that would be a superficial change compared to fixing what's behind the stores.
#mistake test for stoner
>stoner
"Hey, man! Don't depersonalize me! Or I'll throw something at you!" you hear from inside Store N.
>stoner
"Like, don't do it again, dude, or I will literally totally throw these empty bottles at you."
The door to Store N opens, and two bottles whizz in your direction but nowhere close. They're bright red, and they appear to be lotions or something.
>stoner
You've teased the person in Store N enough. You should have enough clues to figure his name now, anyway.
#mistake test for storge
>storge
You have a momentary vision of an apocryphal eighth book in the Harry Potter series sitting by a pillar, but it passes.
>storge
Stop trying to make Pillar of Storge happen.
#mistake test for stroke
>stroke
You need a stroke of genius, but that's all wrong. You are left seeing red a bit. But this puzzle probably isn't worth risking your health over.
#mistake test for sureto or sure to
>sureto or sure to
You'll be sure to figure it out sooner or later. You see red a bit at not quite being there yet.
#mistake retest for throes
>throes
No, you are not in your last throes. Neither is Yorpwald. Try looking at stores at the other end of the alphabet.
#mistake test for tosher
>tosher
Insults will get you nowhere. You see red at thinking such a word.
#mistake test for toyers
>toyers
You see red at the possibility people might mess with your mind in whatever's behind store Y--especially after noting the TOYERS with the red line through in the window.
#mistake test for troyes
>troyes
Store Y does not lead to France.

Cruelest Lectures

@nud
#spechelp for lecturer

>nia
Ian's had a big life change, but that might be too big for him!

You might be suspected of having the munchies if you tried that.

#spechelp for store p
>presot
You hear old forgotten magic words which seem like they might almost apply if they were in the right order.
#scannotes for tropes poster
>scan tropes poster
I guess it's a trope that something with a trope might help you with the general principles of when the settler is vague. Perhaps you can knock out one of the first two letters.
