The big L may be some sort of clue, but you can't do anything with it.

It's just one letter in the maze. You may want to focus on the whole volt maze.

You come to four-fifths of a revelation, but it's not about this maze, sadly.

>n
>glib
You'll need to be glib with something like g-lib later. If you get through this maze. In fact, maybe being glib might be easier than walking through.
>lawls
You try to laugh at the walls, but such actions don't seem to work here.

>talk to lev
"I'm here to help, just by being me, apparently."
>e
You walk into a wall, which goes ZVT. "Lame-o," you think, seeing red. Maybe that ZVT was a VZT.
Lev Matzo cringes
>e
You decide against touching a wall to see the (ZVT/VZT)/Lame-o routine and see red again at the memory.
!Lev Matzo cringes
>n
As the dreidl chases you away, you see Lev Matzo throwing his hands up as if he wished he could have done more.

>{include} _ltovl
>talk to lev
"I'm here to help, just by being me, apparently."
>scan lev
That helped, but maybe cheat mode would be really useful. At eight letters for the right word, this volt maze is pretty tricky!

As the dreidl chases you away, you see someone walk into view to replace Lev Matzo.

That didn't show anything new. Maybe cheat mode would be better.
>cheat
>scan lev
>n
As the dreidl chases you away, you see someone else walk into view to replace Matzo Lev.

As the dreidl chases you away, you hear Tom Alvez moan "Wait! I don't have a replacement?!"

Phat Path

>n
You can only go south here.

>abstract yak to ll
>s
You feel you're missing something. You probably should see about that area west of the hump.

>gonear gyre
>umph
>gonear shack
>s

You feel you're missing something. You probably should see about the hoop in Austerer Treasure.

>gonear austerer
>pooh

>gonear hacks' shack
>s
You feel you're missing something. You probably should see about what that onyx censer could become.

>gonear phat path
>screen
Back at Hacks' Shack

>n
You can only go south here.

>s
That yak. Maybe you could release it from its yoke.

>abstract yak to ll
>abstract yoke to ll
>purloin keyboard
>gonear shack

>n
Nothing north, but you need to just sit and finish things here anyway.
>s
You should have what you need. It might be dangerous, or just plain distracting, to go back out with all this computer work.
