The big L may be some sort of clue, but you can't do anything with it

#dupnudge for mazeroom

any way to tackle this one room

#nudge for bigm
>bigm
It's just one letter in the maze. You may want to focus on the whole volt maze.

#nudge for floor
>rolfo
You think about doing something to the floor. But making it disappear would probably be fatal. Best find another angle.

#nudge for dreidl

You won't be able to do anything to the dreidl to see it, but it'll be so horrifying once you do, you won't be able to focus. Catch-22.
>n
giant spinning robot dreidl pushes you back to the start of the maze as it belts riddle after riddle

Grey Gyre

#nudge for grye
>egry
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>blepe
The plebe looks confused, as if you garbled what you said.
>bleep
You try and cuss, but the plebe is not intimidated by your civilian clothes. Perhaps you need something proclaiming your authority.
>blepe
No, you were right before, there. You just need some help to make that magic word in your notepad work, now. Or maybe you don't!

>hmup
The hump suddenly looks a bit smaller. But not enough.

>umph
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip hump.

You ham up "Hup, ma!" to get over a hump, which vanishes.

Austerer Treasure

#nudge for austerer
>austerre
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>w
The treasure room has no secret passages--so you can only go back east.

>hoop
The hoop dips a bit as if to taunt you.

>hoopey
The hoop dips a bit as if to taunt you.

>phooey

#nudge for onyx
>oynx
You consider the odd letters in such a short word, then  think "X, Y, ... no." Maybe the censer is just a censer, and the coloring is a clue to what it can be.

>escern
That feels right, but it's not enough yet. You don't need anything grumbly, here.

#nudge for onyxcenser
>onyxcenser
You let out a string of something that feels good to say, but it doesn't mean anything. Maybe you're overthinking, and the color doesn't matter.

>e
>lbma
The lamb looks confused. Maybe you could be more forceful. Verbally, not physically.

>blam
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip lamb.

You make pretend the gun noises as you point your finger at the poor little lamb. It runs off, scared. But the right kind of scared! And towards greener--well, less grey--pastures.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

DEBUG INFO: Adding a min point for this flip.

Brunt

#nudge for brunt

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

#nudge for decorative
>decoratiev
You consider some over-long epithet to get the star, but no, it's gotta be something quick. Visceral. Not necessarily rude.

>arts
Being an arts tsar won't help. You need a word that shows anger.

>srat
The Self-Referential Aptitude Test is an interesting puzzle, but you have enough on your mind, right now.

>tsar
Being an arts tsar won't help. You need a word that shows anger.

##nudge for stump
>stmpu
The stump doesn't move, but the star seems to rattle a bit

>rats
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip decorative star.

You're frustrated you can't reach that star in the stump, and you bang your fists on the stump and say RATS! Then you wiggle a finger in absent-mindedly, and while you're not thinking of it, or of getting your fingers stuck in a cut in the stump, pop, the star comes out! It's the sort you can affix to your clothes and look important with, so you do.

#dupnudge for decorative
>decoratiev
The star's snazzy enough as-is.

#nudge for gasp
>gpas
You try, but fail, to make something out of nothing.

#nudge for gpa
>gpa
You try, but fail, to make something out of nothing.

>spag
You don't have time to read text-adventuring magazines right now. You're too busy living them.

The dumpster and red stump are both pretty sturdy, but you might be able to get what's in the dumpster.

#nudge for spumed

The dumpster and red stump are both pretty sturdy, but you might be able to get what's in the dumpster.

#nudge for tar
>tar
The dumpster and red stump are both pretty sturdy, but you might be able to get what's in the dumpster.

#nudge for adumpster

Not even you can make that icky stuff in the dumpster worthwhile, but maybe there's something useful inside.

#nudge for stump
>stmpu
The stump just sits there, stumpy

>n
#nudge for mazeltov
>ovelzamt
The volt maze crackles with increased energy, almost ready to break down. Oy vey! I hope this one's not too meshuggenah.

Some 4-letter word or other will get the dart.

The camo-coma fields are just obvious enough to anyone paying attention, for legal reasons. Plus, either you are awake enough to see them, or you get too tired to walk into the center. West is the only way out.

#nudge for camo

The number's got more numerals than letters

#nudge for popgun
>popgun
Hmm. It's not the popgun itself that's cracked but the boing mechanism inside


#nudge for bingo
>bigon
You try something that doesn't quite work

>bingo

#nudge for spoilt
>spoilt
The popgun is just fine

#nudge for number

Dirge Ridge

#nudge for liev

The vile veil is impassive. It--kind of protects you, actually.

#nudge for ole
>oel
There are only six possibilities. Leo's not too bright, and he can figure it out.

>ole

#nudge for leonard
>lorenda
You don't need to face double the strength

#nudge for darn
>dran
Use the settler. This is a, err, regional word.

>darn

#dupnudge for leonard
>lorenda
You need to concentrate on them being washups. Combining them would mean they couldn't have a friend

#nudge for whasup
>whasup
That feels almost right, but you remember that that word has 2 s's in a row.

>upshasw
You mumble a greeting that doesn't quite seem to work. Hm, that's not quite it.

>whassup

>lorenda
You don't need to combine them physically, but their physical strengths combined could be a help.

#nudge for dirge
>idger
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

You walk forward. That dangerous looking ether? It hid some dangerous looking people.

Leo and Rand might help you win the fight, but you'll need some way to find the people in the ether .

#nudge for ether
>theer
The ether pulses, but you still can't see through it.

>there
Leo and Rand charge in. It's two-on-three, though, since your popgun doesn't have any ammunition. You all walk back, on-ho changed to oh-no. Leo and Rand shake off their bruises.

#nudge for mount
>moutn
Mount Um, Not silently disposes of your attempts to manipulate it.

#nudge for lawl
>llwa
It's too expansive for you to use any mental energy on.

>harms
Despite being dangerous to walk into, Harm's Marsh serves an important ecological purpose I can't explain here. So, best not to meddle.

>hram
Despite being dangerous to walk into, Harm's Marsh serves an important ecological purpose I can't explain here. So, best not to meddle.

#nudge for hog
>gho
You need to deal with all the hogs.

#nudge for key
>kye
You aren't sure which key would work, so you need a plan to get them all.

>syke
Syke-illogical

>undo
>gosh
You pretend like you're giving up, and there's no way the hogs can beat you. You wink at Rand and Leo as they gang up on you as you make one last obvious effort--BAM! POW! The wall collapses with an "Aw, LOL. Allow all...ow!"
Phat Path

#nudge for phat

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

##nudge for shack
##nudge for shakc

You'll need to enter the shack to take care of things here.

>wanring
You can't change warnings. Warnings are there to protect you. Even offer hints if you read them.

#nudge for sgin
>sgin
Look at what's on the sign.

>atler
It's kind of tough to say goodbye, firmly but kindly, and--that isn't quite it. You feel a bit jumbled.

It's kind of tough to say goodbye, firmly but kindly, and--that isn't quite it. You feel a bit jumbled.

It's kind of tough to say goodbye, firmly but kindly, and--that isn't quite it. You feel a bit jumbled.

##nudge for saps

You pass through all ten reshufflings of Saps' Pass, then feel like a bit of a sap, yourself. You pretty clearly need to go north, here.

#nudge for entyr
>ytner
No way you'll be able to meddle with the Entry from outside.

#dupnudge for leonard

You've probably faced the greatest physical threat you need. You need to take leave of them, now.

The rebuff-buffer is too technical for you, but even if it weren't, removing its protection would be unwise.

The magnetic magic-net is too technical for you, but even if it weren't, removing its protection would be unwise.

#nudge for computer

You need to fix the program in the computer, well, once you get it running.

There are buttons all over the shack, but they should remain that way. You may have to figure or change their functions, though.

It's just gum.

#nudge for stickofgum
>stickofgum
It's just gum.

>mug
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip mug.

The gum, being gum, morphs easily into a new shape -- a mug with annoying smile. Smug Mugs are, sadly, still in fashion in Yorpwald. But they often have a right to be--some even replenish what's in them.

Microscopic bubbles seem to form on the coal and burst in the air.

#nudge for pile

It's not just any pile--it's a pile of coal.

It's risky to boot without a disk, like that skid used to be, in the disk drive. Much less reboot.
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]

>get disk

Specifically, no input device

>compeli
Man! That's the thing about compiling. Switch one or two characters, and foom, it's just as bad as if you were completely off-base.

Hm, might be fun to try something like that again.

You need to find something less awful that could make a keyboard. That book would probably arrange the letters worse than QWERTY.

>leaf
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip giant fallen leaf.

The hopefully only recently dead giant flea becomes a recently dead giant leaf, which looks much better due to all the pretty colors it's turned. It's light for its size, so you pick it up.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>sdik
The disk seems to want to expand, but not quite into that. You must be close.

>skid
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip skid.

By some lossless easily reversible algorithm, the disk changes to a skid with a floppy pop-fly. The skid's too big to carry, but you can PUSH or PULL it around.

You make a note you can flip the disk back based on the lossless compression algorithm, etc., and how you don't need to know the deep math cold to be able to use it, or to remember the basics.

It's not just any yoke. It's a drab yoke. I mean, a particularly drab yoke. On the bored yak.

#nudge for yak

The yak doesn't seem to react to three plain letters thrown around like that. Its look indicates not only that it is bored, but it wants to let people know it's bored, too bored to do so actively. The drab yoke it is wearing probably does not help.

You try but get EXCESSIVE UPPERCASE ERROR. Even converting the code in all upper case, you'd also have to refer to lower-case include files and so forth. You try other work-arounds, like the shift key, but the computer holds all the chips, somehow. (Sorry.) You must be close to a successful compile.

>compile

#nudge for tbakey

Nothing happens. It's probably just the TBA you need to work with, which certainly cuts things down.

You get an NEED IF-DEFINE error the first time you try to compile. "Up late, a letup," you think restlessly and dreamily to yourself, "Then fail the final!"

You're just too exhausted to put up with another compiling speel (you're too tired to check if that's spelt right)...slipping on virtual peels...probably you just switched something or got something backwards.

The process of debugging is going to take a while. You will need some sort of energy. That bottle of cola just won't be enough for the task ahead.
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]

You don't want to guzzle it before you need to. In fact, you wish there would be a way to make more of it, because there really isn't much left. It'd be outstanding to have giant donuts, but you have what you have.
