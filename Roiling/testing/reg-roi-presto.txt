The plebe looks confused, as if you garbled what you said.

You try and cuss, but the plebe is not intimidated by your civilian clothes. Perhaps you need something proclaiming your authority.

That feels right, but it's not enough yet. You don't need anything profane, here.

DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip decorative star.

You're frustrated you can't reach that star in the stump, and you bang your fists on the stump and say RATS! Then you wiggle a finger in absent-mindedly, and while you're not thinking of it, or of getting your fingers stuck in a cut in the stump, pop, the star comes out! It's the sort you can affix to your clothes and look important with, so you do.

Nothing happens. It's probably just the TBA you need to work with, which certainly cuts things down.

>bta
DEBUG INFO: The hash of the command is 123716741. Hash of word 1 is 123716741.

The TBA key rattles within the keyboard a bit.

>bat
You don't want to take a bat to the keyboard. Or have a bat swoop and take it. Trust me.

It's what's on the scratch paper that is important.

It'd sort of stink if a caps lock button broke in real life, so, no.

You'll need to re-enter the shack to take care of things here.

>compeli
You've assembled the letters incorrectly.

>put caps in keyboard
It fits in perfectly, right beneath the TBA (ehh? That's not quite right) key.

>compile
You get one of those annoying NEGLECT A CLEAN GET?! errors that proclaims this version so riven needs a raged-up upgrade with autolibs' bailouts. The automatic installer is on nil-alerts. They'll need a manual un-maul. Perhaps you need to do something to reset the computer--a look at the drive might help.

>x screen
A bunch of nonsense code that might not even work.

>x code
A bunch of nonsense code that might not even work.

>compile
You get an NEED IF-DEFINE error the first time you try to compile. "Up late, a letup," you think restlessly and dreamily to yourself, "Then fail the final!"

You're just too exhausted to put up with another compiling speel (you're too tired to check if that's spelt right)...slipping on virtual peels...probably you just switched something or got something backwards.

>sleep
You feel smarter

>compile
You successfully compile your code. Wahoo! Wooha! Core dev covered! But you hear a shwoop, then say whoops. The 

>compidle
DEBUG INFO: The hash of the command is 486541157. Hash of word 1 is 486541157.

The code won't BUDGE.

Hmm. Compiled code is tricky. Once it's fixed, if you have even one thing in the wrong order, it does nothing right. That MUST be what's happening here.

>debug
The process of debugging is going to take a while. You will need some sort of energy. That bottle of cola just won't be enough for the task ahead.
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]

>drink cola
You don't want to guzzle it before you need to. In fact, you wish there would be a way to make more of it, because there really isn't much left. It'd be outstanding to have giant donuts, but you have what you have.

>put cola in mug

Now that the fizzy cola's in the mug, you will ration it as you need to.

It's built to be sturdy. You don't want to mess with it.

Hmm. There are only five possibilities, and more than one may be right. You've done the tough stuff.
