The big L may be some sort of clue, but you can't do anything with it

It's just one letter in the maze. You may want to focus on the whole volt maze.

You think about doing something to the floor. But making it disappear would probably be fatal. Best find another angle.

WRONG WRITE UP MATZO LEV CLUES ETC
Grey Gyre
>egry
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant.

>blepe
The plebe looks confused, as if you garbled what you said.
>bleep
You try and cuss, but the plebe is not intimidated by your civilian clothes. Perhaps you need something proclaiming your authority.
>blepe
No, you were right before, there. You just need some help to make that magic word in your notepad work, now. Or maybe you don't!

>hmup
The hump suddenly looks a bit smaller. But not enough.

>umph
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip hump.

You ham up "Hup, ma!" to get over a hump, which vanishes.

Austerer Treasure

>w
The treasure room has no secret passages--so you can only go back east.

>hoop
The hoop dips a bit as if to taunt you.

>hoopey
The hoop dips a bit as if to taunt you.

>phooey
>oynx
You consider the odd letters in such a short word, then  think "X, Y, ... no." Maybe the censer is just a censer, and the coloring is a clue to what it can be.

>escern
That feels right, but it's not enough yet. You don't need anything profane, here.

>onyxcenser
You let out a string of something that feels good to say, but it doesn't mean anything. Maybe you're overthinking, and the color doesn't matter.

>e
>lbma
The lamb looks confused. Maybe you could be more forceful. Verbally, not physically.

>blam
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip lamb.

You make pretend the gun noises as you point your finger at the poor little lamb. It runs off, scared. But the right kind of scared! And towards greener--well, less grey--pastures.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

DEBUG INFO: Adding a min point for this flip.

>s
Brunt

>urbnt
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant.

>decoratiev
You consider some over-long epithet to get the star, but no, it's gotta be something quick. Visceral. Not necessarily rude.

>arts
Being an arts tsar won't help. You need a word that shows anger.

>srat
The Self-Referential Aptitude Test is an interesting puzzle, but you have enough on your mind, right now.

>tsar
Being an arts tsar won't help. You need a word that shows anger.

>stmpu
The stump doesn't move, but the star seems to rattle a bit

>rats
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip decorative star.

You're frustrated you can't reach that star in the stump, and you bang your fists on the stump and say RATS! Then you wiggle a finger in absent-mindedly, and while you're not thinking of it, or of getting your fingers stuck in a cut in the stump, pop, the star comes out! It's the sort you can affix to your clothes and look important with, so you do.

>decoratiev
The star's snazzy enough as-is.

>gpas
You try, but fail, to make something out of nothing.

>spag
You don't have time to read text-adventuring magazines right now. You're too busy living them.

>dma
Here in the Brunt, you don't need to mess with the scenery. Especially scenery farther away and nicer looking than that dumpster.

>amaddam
Here in the Brunt, you don't need to mess with the scenery. Especially scenery farther away and nicer looking than that dumpster.

>thedma
Here in the Brunt, you don't need to mess with the scenery. Especially scenery farther away and nicer looking than that dumpster.

>dumpster
The dumpster and red stump are both pretty sturdy, but you might be able to get what's in the dumpster.

>dumpstera
Not even you can make that icky stuff in the dumpster worthwhile, but maybe there's something useful inside.

>stmpu
The stump just sits there, stumpy

>n
>ovelzamt
The volt maze crackles with increased energy, almost ready to break down.

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant.

The camo-coma fields are just obvious enough to anyone paying attention, for legal reasons. Plus, either you are awake enough to see them, or you get too tired to walk into the center. West is the only way out.

The camo-coma remains as-is. It's sturdy, military-grade stuff

Hmm. It's not the popgun itself that's cracked but the boing mechanism inside

The popgun is just fine

The vile veil is impassive. It--kind of protects you, actually.

>ole
>lorenda
You don't need to face double the strength.

>darn
>lorenda
Well, they're upset, now. You need to concentrate on them being washups.

>whasup
Maybe something like that'd work with just one washup. But there are two.

>upshasw
That's not the slangiest

>whassup

>lorenda
You don't need to combine them physically, but their physical strengths combined could be a help.

>idger
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant.

You try something that doesn't [i]quite[r] work, but you assure yourself it'll put you a bit closer to an a-ha moment.

"Oo Boss. We ain't up to dat maze. It's makes us fink too much!" Leo and Rand wait outside.

>s
>mazeltov

>n
You walk forward. That dangerous looking ether? It hid some dangerous looking people.

>n
Leo and Rand might help you win the fight, but you'll need some way to find the people in the ether .

>theer
The ether pulses, but you still can't see through it.

>there
Leo and Rand charge in. It's two-on-three, though, since your popgun doesn't have any ammunition. You all walk back, on-ho changed to oh-no. Leo and Rand shake off their bruises.

Phat Path

>phta

>moutn
Mount Um, Not silently disposes of your attempts to manipulate it.

>thwa
Whazzat?

>llwa
It's too expansive for you to use any mental energy on.

>harms
Despite being dangerous to walk into, Harm's Marsh serves an important ecological purpose I can't explain here. So, best not to meddle.

>hram
Despite being dangerous to walk into, Harm's Marsh serves an important ecological purpose I can't explain here. So, best not to meddle.

>phta
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant.

>gho
You need to deal with all the hogs.

>kye
You aren't sure which key would work, so you need a plan to get them all.

>syke
Syke-illogical

>gosh
You pretend like you're giving up, and there's no way the hogs can beat you. You wink at Rand and Leo as they gang up on you as you make one last obvious effort--BAM! POW! The wall collapses with an "Aw, LOL. Allow all...ow!"

>ahskc
You'll need to enter the shack to take care of things here.

>wanring
You can't change warnings. Warnings are there to protect you. Even offer hints if you read them.

>sgin
Look at what's on the sign.

>atler
It's kind of tough to say goodbye, firmly but kindly, and--that isn't quite it. You feel a bit jumbled.

>snogol
It's kind of tough to say goodbye, firmly but kindly, and--that isn't quite it. You feel a bit jumbled.

>outhg
It's kind of tough to say goodbye, firmly but kindly, and--that isn't quite it. You feel a bit jumbled.

>spsa
You pass through all ten reshufflings of Saps' Pass, then feel like a bit of a sap, yourself. You pretty clearly need to go north, here.

>ytner
No way you'll be able to meddle with the Entry from outside.

>leonadr
You've probably faced the greatest physical threat you need. You need to take leave of them, now.

>ettlers
You may want to focus on the highlighted letters on the sign.

>catechism
The catechism would be more likely to scramble YOU up. It'll be there when you need to gloss over it.

The catechism would be more likely to scramble YOU up. It'll be there when you need to gloss over it.

>rebuff
The rebuff-buffer is too technical for you, but even if it weren't, removing its protection would be unwise.

>magnetic
The magnetic magic-net is too technical for you, but even if it weren't, removing its protection would be unwise.

>computer
You need to fix the program in the computer, well, once you get it running.

>bottun
There are buttons all over the shack, but they should remain that way. You may have to figure or change their functions, though.

>bottuns
There are buttons all over the shack, but they should remain that way. You may have to figure or change their functions, though.

>escarole
All the escaroles.

They're not just socks, or trim. They're trim socks.

>ugm
You stare at the gum. Hm, only a few ways it can be stretched or whatever.

>stick
It's just gum.

>stickofgum
It's just gum.

>mug
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip mug.

The gum, being gum, morphs easily into a new shape -- a mug with annoying smile. Smug Mugs are, sadly, still in fashion in Yorpwald. But they often have a right to be--some even replenish what's in them.

>calo
Microscopic bubbles seem to form on the coal and burst in the air.

>peil
It's not just any pile--it's a pile of coal.

>cola

>caffeine
The name brand is not important. Besides, your body will break down the caffeine on its own, when needed.

>fine
The name brand is not important. Besides, your body will break down the caffeine on its own, when needed.

>face
The name brand is not important. Besides, your body will break down the caffeine on its own, when needed.

>adso
It's cola, not soda or pop. And you can just drink it.

>ppo
It's cola, not soda or pop. And you can just drink it.

>trimsocks
You don't have the available memory in your head to see all the possibilities, but yes, something like that MUST work.

There must be a more eco-friendly way to reincarnate the flea.

>elfa
The flea makes a crinkly noise but still seems quite dead.

>elpes
tired jumble

>bkoo
The catechism would be more likely to scramble YOU up. It'll be there when you need to gloss over it.

That computer probably holds important information--you just need to extract it right, by trying other things.

>fountina
It's too small to be a fountain--really, just a fount.

>colck
You can't make much out of a clock, but clock sap, maybe.
>puddle
You can't make much out of a clock, but clock sap, maybe.

>aps
C'est pas sap. C'est du CLOCK SAP.

>caps lock
>screen
>put screen on slab

>ebroot
You need to give that computer another (figurative) kick.

>reboot
It's risky to boot without a disk, like that disk right there, in the disk drive. Much less reboot.
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]

>get disk
>put disk in drive
No input device

>compeli
Man! That's the thing about compiling. Switch one or two characters, and foom, it's just as bad as if you were completely off-base.

>compile
Good idea, but tough to program without a keyboard.
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]
>undo

>oftun
Hm, might be fun to try something like that again.

>futon
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip futon.

The fount turns into a futon, which is better off not wet. There's rest, eh? you think, looking at it, though you're not really tired yet.

>bekaydor
The book is unchangably bad. Sure, there are probably good parodies to be written, but that's not your area of wordsmithing. 

>keyboard
The book is unchangably bad. Sure, there are probably good parodies to be written, but that's not your area of wordsmithing. That seems like a

You need to find something less awful that could make a keyboard. That book would probably arrange the letters worse than QWERTY.

>s

>leaf
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip giant fallen leaf.

The hopefully only recently dead giant flea becomes a recently dead giant leaf, which looks much better due to all the pretty colors it's turned. It's light for its size, so you pick it up.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>sdik
The disk seems to want to expand, but not quite into that. You must be close.

>skid
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip skid.

By some lossless easily reversible algorithm, the disk changes to a skid with a floppy pop-fly. The skid's too big to carry, but you can PUSH or PULL it around.

You make a note you can flip the disk back based on the lossless compression algorithm, etc., and how you don't need to know the deep math cold to be able to use it, or to remember the basics.

>repo
You don't need to do anything with the skid's rope.

>put leaf on skid
>push skid s
Hacks' Shack

>dksi
Bleah. Did all this high-tech work make you forget the skid was a disk? Yes. Yes, it did.

>disk
>put disk in drive

>yeko
It's not just any yoke. It's a drab yoke. I mean, a particularly drab yoke. On the bored yak.

>aky
The yak doesn't seem to react to three plain letters thrown around like that. His look indicates not only that he is bored, but that he wants to let people know he's bored, but he's too bored to do that actively. The drab yoke he is wearing probably does not help.

>abrd
It's not just drab. It's a drab yoke. On the bored yak.

>scratchings
You may wish to decipher the scratchings, instead.

>scratching
You may wish to decipher the scratchings, instead.

>reboot
The keyboard isn't connected. This probably wouldn't be fatal, but why not do first things first?

>put keyboard on slab

>ntotobe
Even more nothing happens than you expected. The blue button really is too broken. But the orange is not.

>compile
You try but get EXCESSIVE UPPERCASE ERROR. Even converting the code in all upper case, you'd also have to refer to lower-case include files and so forth. You try other work-arounds, like the shift key, but the computer holds all the chips, somehow. (Sorry.) You must be close to a successful compile.

>compile
successfully compile your code

>tebkay
Nothing happens. It's probably just the TBA you need to work with, which certainly cuts things down.

>bta
The TBA key rattles within the keyboard a bit.

>bat
You don't want to take a bat to the keyboard. Or have a bat swoop and take it. Trust me.

>scartch
It's what's on the scratch paper that is important.

>pprea
It's what's on the scratch paper that is important.

>cpsa
It'd sort of stink if a caps lock button broke in real life, so, no.

>lcko
It'd sort of stink if a caps lock button broke in real life, so, no.

>s
>shcka
You'll need to re-enter the shack to take care of things here.
>n

>compeli
You've assembled the letters incorrectly.

>put caps in keyboard
It fits in perfectly, right beneath the TBA (ehh? That's not quite right) key.

>compile
You get one of those annoying NEGLECT A CLEAN GET?! errors that proclaims this version so riven needs a raged-up upgrade with autolibs' bailouts. The automatic installer is on nil-alerts. They'll need a manual un-maul. Perhaps you need to do something to reset the computer--a look at the drive might help.

>x screen
A bunch of nonsense code that might not even work.

>x code
A bunch of nonsense code that might not even work.

>compile
You get an NEED IF-DEFINE error the first time you try to compile. "Up late, a letup," you think restlessly and dreamily to yourself, "Then fail the final!"

You're just too exhausted to put up with another compiling speel (you're too tired to check if that's spelt right)...slipping on virtual peels...probably you just switched something or got something backwards.

>sleep
You feel smarter

>compile
You successfully compile your code. Wahoo! Wooha! Core dev covered! But you hear a shwoop, then say whoops. The 

>compidle
The code won't BUDGE.

>cedo
The code won't BUDGE.

>ebdug
Hmm. Compiled code is tricky. Once it's fixed, if you have even one thing in the wrong order, it does nothing right. That MUST be what's happening here.

>debug
The process of debugging is going to take a while. You will need some sort of energy. That bottle of cola just won't be enough for the task ahead.
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]

>drink cola
You don't want to guzzle it before you need to. In fact, you wish there would be a way to make more of it, because there really isn't much left. It'd be outstanding to have giant donuts, but you have what you have.

>put cola in mug
>drink cola
Now that the fizzy cola's in the mug, you will ration it as you need to.
>drink mug
Now that the fizzy cola's in the mug, you will ration it as you need to.

It's built to be sturdy. You don't want to mess with it.
