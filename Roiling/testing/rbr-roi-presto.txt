You consider the odd letters in such a short word, then  think 'X, Y, ... no.' Maybe the censer is just a censer, and the coloring is a clue to what it can be.
#nudge for onyxcenser

The locs pack mentions, in red, Polacck's products are shoddy imitations of, well, this. Don't be fooled!

It's too small to be a fountain--really, just a fount.

#nudge for yak
>yka
The yak doesn't seem to react to three plain letters thrown around like that. Its look indicates not only that it is bored, but it wants to let people know it's bored, too bored to do so actively. The drab yoke it is wearing probably does not help.
#nudge for yoke

It's not just any yoke. It's a drab yoke. I mean, a particularly drab yoke. On the bored yak.

You don't need to resummon the bored yak. And programming exercises can become enough of a drab yoke.

Nothing happens. It's probably just the TBA you need to work with, which certainly cuts things down.

You need to fix the program in the computer, well, once you get it running.

It says DRIVE A/A DRIVE: VARIED

It's alternately referred to as Drive E and E Drive. But wait! There's some kibitzing in red, which you can see if you READ again
