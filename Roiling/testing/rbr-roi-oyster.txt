Nobody pays attention to your performance as you disobey the sign. Or try to. I guess the sign doesn't strictly disallow THAT.

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

Dealing with just one troll would cause the rest to call you a bully and beat you up. Gotta take 'em all, somehow.

You can't pick out which tumbler to do something to. But you're annoyed by their tips, which make you see red.
#nudge for stumbler

Someone looks at you funny. "What are you muttering?" Maybe it's the writing on the tumblers, instead.

You can't change the jukebox. The bad music has seeped into it. But maybe you can put it out of commission.
