#nudge for storey

Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for posh
>pohs
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#nudge for tine
>tien
Just one tine doesn't seem up to much.
#nudge for troll
>troll
Dealing with just one troll would cause the rest to call you a bully and beat you up. Gotta take 'em all, somehow.
#nudge for recap

#nudge for stumbler
>stumblre
Someone looks at you funny. "What are you muttering?" Maybe it's the writing on the tumblers, instead.
#nudge for jukebox

You can't change the jukebox. The bad music has seeped into it. But maybe you can put it out of commission.
#nudge for remap

#nudge for unset

The tunes grow slightly less annoying, for a moment.
