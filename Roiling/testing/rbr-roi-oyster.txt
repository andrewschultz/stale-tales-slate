You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

Dealing with just one troll would cause the rest to call you a bully and beat you up. Gotta take 'em all, somehow.

As you seek to change the canoe, you hear a rush of water, quickly examine the canoe, and realize that the red fish cutting the tree there is, in fact, a herring. The last thing you needed was more water! But it is too late to change the ocean back. You don't even see if Shoer Osher's statue was washed away as well.
