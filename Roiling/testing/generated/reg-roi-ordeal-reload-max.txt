#verbcase sleep-ordeal-reload-default
You probably can't spend another night in the Means Manse. You need to get going, here!

>lamp
Your score has just gone up by one point.

#Okay, first, let's take care of everything that's here by default. Let's put it in alphabetical order as well.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-access
>pad access
Typing SCR or SCREEN toggles handicapped accessibility mode, which generally helps the visually impaired with graphics clues and avoids a stream of useless punctuation. It is currently off.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-directions/dirs
>pad dirs
A Roiling Original uses north, south, east and west. You may be able to go in or out, too, especially when only one exit is listed.

>
>pad free turns
Some actions do not take a turn. For instance, examining, looking or taking inventory, or "out of world" actions like SCORE, will not cost you time if you are in a tight situation.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-go-to
>pad go to
You can GT/GO TO/GOTO a location or thing if it's a bit far away but in the region.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-old-warpy
>pad old warpy
Old Warpy is the force that allows people to move between distant areas of Yorpwald that need help. It aided you so long ago getting to the Trips Strip, and it may aid you again. You always wondered where else it led, but you knew if you found out, Yorpwald would be in trouble.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-options
>pad options
--Typing SCR or SCREEN toggles handicapped accessibility mode, which generally helps the visually impaired with graphics clues and avoids a stream of useless punctuation. It is currently off.
POSS toggles whether you can see the maximum/minimum score for a region. It is a potential meta-spoiler, but it can be helpful, too.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-red
>pad red
Stuff that's all red, or an idea that makes you or someone see red, is all wrong, which is a clue in its own way.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-retry
>pad retry
You wrote notes about how you can RETRY thanks to Terry if you get stuck somewhere past a store.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-shuffling-around
>pad shuffling
Postmortems? Most sport em. Details: I lasted. I miss my tagged gadget and how it helped me through the Forest (store F,) Sortie (store I,) and Metros (store M) in the Trips Strip. To the resort (store R.) Redness = guised guides (letters all wrong.)

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-tagged-gadget
>pad tagged
You wrote some notes about the Tagged Gadget from Shuffling Around in here, about Certify and Rectify modes. How Certify showed all the right letters, and Rectify made the first and last right. You could do with a new thingamabob now. Probably a bunch of different commands to use, though.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-verbs
>pad verbs
--N, S, E and W are the basic directions, though UP and DOWN are used occasionally, and IN or OUT may work.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-warp
>pad warp
FOURTH WALL NOTE: if you solved whatever is behind Store P, U, V, W, or Y in an early release, you can type the final command to bypass that area, though each area has been substantially upgraded since release 3. Also, the final command changed between versions for some areas, because they were (hopefully) improved, so you can use either. The game will warn you if you used an old one.

#Next, let's get entries that are relatively easy to pick off

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-long-commands
>this is a test here
[NOTE: you probably don't need more than four words per command. The most complex ones are PUT X ON Y or ASK X ABOUT Y, and a compound item like GIANT PIN can use GIANT or PIN. Adjectives usually aren't necessary, and GET ALL will never take anything harmful or lethal.]
[You record the information about long commands in your pedanto-notepad.]
>pad long commands
Commands over 4 words long aren't necessary. You can say TAKE or GET ALL, eliminate THE, or use half an open compound word without repercussions.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-poss
>pad poss
POSS toggles whether you can see the maximum/minimum score for a region. It is a potential meta-spoiler, but it can be helpful, too.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-sl
>x slider
[NOTE: You can type SL to toggle the slider in the future.]
>pad sl
Shortcut command to turn slider on.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-spaces
>scan pin
[NOTE: if your interpreter supports Glulx, see the top for a graphical representation of the colorings. You can also type SPACE ON or SON to space out the text if you are visually impaired, or NO SPACE or NOS to lump the text back. Also, LA repeats what you scanned last, if the window on top does not show it.]
>pad spaces
To put spaces in letters settler readings, type SPACEON or SON. NOSPACE or NOS reverses this.

Yay! You're still changing things to other things, just like in Shuffling Around. For now. But you're on home turf, now. If you get out in the world, maybe it'll be trickier.

Largely All-Grey Gallery

>snib
in Manor! You've found all the secrets here. You can just exit the gallery now, but it'd be a good idea to examine the settler, first.

>in
You look at your settler and realize you didn't really EXAMINE it. Maybe you should, before going out in the world. You've been able to guess what to do so far, with the help of heuristics and generally knowing what's in a house, but you may need technical help you can rely on when you hit less friendly areas.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-saying
>say cheese
If you want to say or think a magic word, you can just type it. So instead of SAY XYZZY, you can use the command XYZZY.
You can ASK someone ABOUT something, if you want to talk to them.
After this, the game will ignore words like say.
>pad saying
Instead of SAYing or THINKing, you can just type the word.

"Well done." A scepter appears in the Respect Specter's hands before disappearing with a pop. "Oops, forgot to warn you, it wasn't real. But it wouldn't have been useful. Besides, the real treasure is the puzzles you solved along the way. I respect your need to do more and talk less. There are things I would have liked to explain. But maybe you know them well enough, or maybe you can figure them out on your own, and it'll be more rewarding that way."

"I offer you much luck and respect in your journey. I am impressed you want to get on with things and not worry about silly trivia and points like, um, me," the Respect Specter calls, with a hint of sadness.
"Oh. One more thing. Instead of the scepter you could've had, have Inducted Deductin'. It's got examples of how to use the settler. Just in case you need to brush up. It might spoil too much. So you can DROP it. But if you want it, here it is."
