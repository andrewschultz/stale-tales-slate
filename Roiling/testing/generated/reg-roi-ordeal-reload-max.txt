There's no need to tidy your study up just now. Still, that seems right, so you file that idea away for later.
In fact, you realize the notepad on the chair would be a great place to file that idea. It'll help tame lots that's meta, mate.
Taking the pedanto-notepad uncovered some sad ads on the chair.

#Okay, first, let's take care of everything that's here by default. Let's put it in alphabetical order as well.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-access
>pad access
Typing SCR or SCREEN toggles handicapped accessibility mode, which generally helps the visually impaired with graphics clues and avoids a stream of useless punctuation. It is currently off.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-directions/dirs
>pad dirs
A Roiling Original uses north, south, east and west. You may be able to go in or out, too, especially when only one exit is listed.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-free-turns
>pad free turns
Some actions do not take a turn. For instance, examining, looking or taking inventory, or "out of world" actions like SCORE, will not cost you time if you are in a tight situation.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-go-to
>pad go to
You can GT/GO TO/GOTO a location or thing if it's a bit far away but in the region.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-old-warpy
>pad old warpy
Old Warpy is the force that allows people to move between distant areas of Yorpwald that need help. It aided you so long ago getting to the Trips Strip, and it may aid you again. You always wondered where else it led, but you knew if you found out, Yorpwald would be in trouble.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-options
>pad options
--Typing SCR or SCREEN toggles handicapped accessibility mode, which generally helps the visually impaired with graphics clues and avoids a stream of useless punctuation. It is currently off.
POSS toggles whether you can see the maximum/minimum score for a region. It is a potential meta-spoiler, but it can be helpful, too.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-red
>pad red
Stuff that's all red, or an idea that makes you or someone see red, is all wrong, which is a clue in its own way.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-retry
>pad retry
You wrote notes about how you can RETRY thanks to Terry if you get stuck somewhere past a store.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-shuffling-around
>pad shuffling
Postmortems? Most sport em. Details: I lasted. I miss my tagged gadget and how it helped me through the Forest (store F,) Sortie (store I,) and Metros (store M) in the Trips Strip. To the resort (store R.) Redness = guised guides (letters all wrong.)

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-tagged-gadget
>pad tagged
You wrote some notes about the Tagged Gadget from Shuffling Around in here, about Certify and Rectify modes. How Certify showed all the right letters, and Rectify made the first and last right. You could do with a new thingamabob now. Probably a bunch of different commands to use, though.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-verbs
>pad verbs
--N, S, E and W are the basic directions, though UP and DOWN are used occasionally, and IN or OUT may work.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-warp
>pad warp
FOURTH WALL NOTE: if you solved whatever is behind Store P, U, V, W, or Y in an early release, you can type the final command to bypass that area, though each area has been substantially upgraded since release 3. Also, the final command changed between versions for some areas, because they were (hopefully) improved, so you can use either. The game will warn you if you used an old one.

Yay! You're still changing things to other things, just like in Shuffling Around. For now. But you're on home turf, now. If you get out in the world, maybe it'll be trickier.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-opt-in/no-tip
>pad no tip
OPT IN lets you see initial region hints. NO TIP turns them off.

#Next, let's get entries that are relatively easy to pick off. Perrot already gave us one.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-parse

PARSE processes the settler's data for you, but SPARE hides it.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-elvira

Apparently, appreciating her is what separates us from the animals. Well, according to Report Porter Perrot.

>scan platform
[NOTE: if your interpreter supports Glulx, see the top for a graphical representation of the colorings. You can also type SPACE ON or SON to space out the text if you are visually impaired, or NO SPACE or NOS to lump the text back. Also, LA repeats what you scanned last, if the window on top does not show it.]

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-long-commands
>this is a test here
[NOTE: you probably don't need more than four words per command. The most complex ones are PUT X ON Y or ASK X ABOUT Y, and a compound item like GIANT PIN can use GIANT or PIN. Adjectives usually aren't necessary, and GET ALL will never take anything harmful or lethal.]
[You record the information about long commands in your notepad.]
>pad long commands
Commands over 4 words long aren't necessary. You can say TAKE or GET ALL, eliminate THE, or use half an open compound word without repercussions.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-poss
>pad poss
POSS toggles whether you can see the maximum/minimum score for a region. It is a potential meta-spoiler, but it can be helpful, too.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-sl

[NOTE: You can type SL to toggle the slider in the future.]

in Manor! You've found all the secrets here. You can just exit the gallery now, but it'd be a good idea to examine the settler, first.

>in
You look at your settler and realize you didn't really EXAMINE it. Maybe you should, before going out in the world. You've been able to guess what to do so far, with the help of heuristics and generally knowing what's in a house, but you may need technical help you can rely on when you hit less friendly areas.

You can ASK someone ABOUT something, if you want to talk to them.
After this, the game will ignore words like say.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-clues
>pad clues
You can LISTEN, ASK people about random stuff, or X/EXAMINE them to figure how to change them.
#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-gretta

>pad gretta
If you can find Gretta Garett-Tatger, she may give you something to help hit at Elvira.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-methods
>pad methods
You probably want to talk to and examine everyone. Even hostile people drop clues when asked about themselves, or stuff in general. Searching and reading writing, or even trying to run past or attack enemies, can offer information, too.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-shatter-threats
>pad shatter threats
It's that new law Elvira got passed, about how you couldn't flip things to their anagrams, because there are too few anagrams--things to change to things--left for you to save Yorpwald again. Well, outside your own house. Of course, if you protested, that would look suspicious.
The title was based on a really convoluted acronym you can't remember.

>scan specter

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-question-mark

The question mark is, well, a question mark. But maybe it's not as vague as it seems. You can HINT it if you're stuck.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-extra/taxer

EXTRA or TAX ER/TAXER toggles more advice for ambiguous/question mark hints. This is close to XTRA, but it is likely the player will want to set TAXER and not EXTRA back.

You will want to ASK others about themselves a lot. Elvira, too, maybe.

>talk to specter
[NOTE: ASK (PERSON) ABOUT (PERSON/THING) or A (THING) is what A Roiling Original uses for detailed conversation. However, TALK is a shortcut to asking an NPC about themselves, which often has clues.]
