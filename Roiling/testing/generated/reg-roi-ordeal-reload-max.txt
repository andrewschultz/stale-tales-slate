Largely All-Grey Gallery

>snib
in Manor! You've found all the secrets here. You can just exit the gallery now, but it'd be a good idea to examine the settler, first.

>in
You look at your settler and realize you didn't really EXAMINE it. Maybe you should, before going out in the world. You've been able to guess what to do so far, with the help of heuristics and generally knowing what's in a house, but you may need technical help you can rely on when you hit less friendly areas.

"Well done." A scepter appears in the Respect Specter's hands before disappearing with a pop. "Oops, forgot to warn you, it wasn't real. But it wouldn't have been useful. Besides, the real treasure is the puzzles you solved along the way. I respect your need to do more and talk less. There are things I would have liked to explain. But maybe you know them well enough, or maybe you can figure them out on your own, and it'll be more rewarding that way."

"I offer you much luck and respect in your journey. I am impressed you want to get on with things and not worry about silly trivia and points like, um, me," the Respect Specter calls, with a hint of sadness.
"Oh. One more thing. Instead of the scepter you could've had, have Inducted Deductin'. It's got examples of how to use the settler. Just in case you need to brush up. It might spoil too much. So you can DROP it. But if you want it, here it is."

"Six ambiguous readings may seem like a lot, but you can maybe stop to think if any need to be vowels or consonants. You can SCAN again if you want more hints."

"I can't tell you the full solution, but you may also note that slot 1 and 7 both possibly being R can cut down the possibilities, too. You may need guesswork at the end if you can't see the word, but there are less possibilities than you think. In this case, you may stumble across the answer, so I can't say anything specific."

Spoiloplis was founded on self-help books, pyramid schemes, and other shady industries. Mayor Irv Lea lauds it as a center of positive thought. And not the nerdy brainy thought that goes into anagrams. You probably can't meet him, but maybe you can upset the social order.

The Wildest Wilteds are not to be traversed lightly. People protecting their territory just because. Bandits sacking taverns for no reason. Castle Apcur, the Curst Palace, lies there, at the other side of Leak Lake. Condemned to be torn down to make a new MoneyCo office. Tax-free and all. Oh, and luxury condos endorsed by Avrile, that lifestyle maven. But if you could restore the palace somehow...
