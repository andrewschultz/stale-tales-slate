#pre-plebe-bleep rule
>bleep
!by one point
You try and cuss, but the plebe is not intimidated by your civilian clothes. Perhaps you need something proclaiming your authority.
#ttc-table-of-presto-prefigurings-plebe

You can shout BLEEP at the plebe once you look more authoritative.

#pre-yak-keyboard rule
>keyboard
The yak emits an air of aggressive apathy. It's like the yak is foiling your attempts, or perhaps you wonder if the yoke might do something nasty to the yak when it changes.
Perhaps it would be an act of kindness to move the yak from bored to sleepy. A bedtime song or story or something.
#ttc-table-of-presto-prefigurings-drab-yoke

You can change the drab yoke to a KEYBOARD once it's free of the bored yak.

You figure it would be a very good idea to move out of the maze before saying that, in case you wind up vanishing along with the maze. So you head back outside as you came. This thinking ahead will be one more thing to congratulate yourself about, at any rate.

You drain the ALocalCo cola bottle. It fills the mug, and you take a tiny sip. The liquid level refills after a minute. It tastes like car fuel, which makes you careful--and hopeful for a far clue. You feel more inspired and calmer than if you'd tried Loco-Alca or Loca-Alco, and your mind's clear enough, you finally see the right way to use a co-alloc. A recycling trap door makes a noise, and you pitch the empty cola bottle into it absent-mindedly.
