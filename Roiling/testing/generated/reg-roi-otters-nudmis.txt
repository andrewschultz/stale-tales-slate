Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

No, you need a couple more letters. Ones that make a word weak enough to control.
#ttc-table-of-otters-spechelp-bleary-barley
>bareyl
The barley rustles in an imaginary wind--but hardly at all.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bleary barley. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-otters-scannotes-bleary-barley
>scan bleary barley
That is a lot of matching for six letters. And you haven't seen anything like the brown before. You're pretty sure. But if you forgot what Elmo said, you can probably guess.

#mistake test for deltaic
>deltaic
Reorganizing the geography around the Edictal Citadel won't help.

#ttc-table-of-otters-nudges-citadel
>citadle
Transform the whole Citadel? No, you couldn't do much with it at full strength. Maybe you can surprise Elvira in there, with help and your powers back. Plus, Elvira checked to make sure you couldn't do anything drastic to the Citadel.
#mistake test for end u
>end u
No, end *U*!

#mistake test for dialect

No, a particular accent or odd word won't destroy the Edictal Citadel. Elvira checked off on all that.

Yup, that's the idea here in Otters.

#mistake test for increds

You marvel at the possible power of the cinders and even see red at the thought of giving them up.

#ttc-table-of-otters-spechelp-ed-riley

Ed Riley looks askance at his deli rye, as if it had some bad aftertaste. If only he said things less loudly, boomingly, startlingly...
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Ed Riley. That's a decent omen.
#mistake test for deli-rye-otters
>lied
You can't think of anything to lie about that would sucker Ed Riley. You try to tell him the people who gave him this "job" lied but realize he doesn't know who you are.
#mistake test for reedy

No, the adverb.
#mistake test for yer
>yer
Yup! It's Ed's!
#mistake test for idle

Ed Riley looks pleased he's pressured you into laziness.

The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: while some words are rather long, you probably see how to guess a letter or two even when you've got your powers back.

#ttc-table-of-otters-spechelp-medals
>quickyl
The medals waver noiselessly. Hm, that's not quite it.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the damsel medals. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-otters-scannotes-medals
>scan medals
The medals clink back and forth and unwind as you scan them. Maybe that might help you. But since you're an old hat by now, and the questionable slots seem -- well, not as bad as a puzzle near the end could be. The seven slots suggest it's not the medals that need attention but what might be engraved on the medals.

You can't do much with Elvira's "real" name. Or her ex-hydra's. You need to act.

For whatever reason, you decide to give Elvira even more power. This time, you don't have the time or guts to reject her phaser.
QUIT, or UNDO the last command.

#mistake test for drop it
>drop it
For whatever reason, you just decide to give up. Elvira cackles. "I knew you'd see it my way." You wind up apologizing on national TV for getting too big for your anagramming britches and accepting a general brainwashing to boot. It's not that bad, only because, well, um, it just isn't. You're thrown in a jail, which can't be anagrammed, but it's for your own good. You're cool with that.

#mistake test for prod it

You prod curiously at the machinery, and soon, Elvira realizes you don't have anything up your sleeve, and you won't be able to retreat in time. The purple pulper and the rest of her army subdue you easily.

The Rancho won't change to the river of the dead just like that, but on the other hand, if you wait around, you'll get to see the river of the dead once Elvira takes action.

It can't be as easy as changing the Rancho. Elvira wouldn't be so careless to allow THAT. You figure you probably need help.
