#this is a general test of a regex with a bad bug--I forgot to test for word boundaries

You think you're on to something, but no--you can't find anything to focus on, thinking that.

#mistake test for id mend/mend id

It's not that easy. Find what to mend.

You remain outside in (relative) light.
#mistake test for dim end/end dim

Okay, if you say so...
NOTE: this joke death was an easter egg. I hope it amused you. The death message below is random, and it's probably easier to read the source or win the game than UNDO and retry them.

#nudge for midden
>middne
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for ottre
>otter
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for storet
>storte
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for bare
>baer
No, you need a couple more letters. Ones that make a word weak enough to control.
#spechelp for bleary barley
>bareyl
The barley rustles in an imaginary wind--but hardly at all.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the bleary barley. That's a decent omen.
#scannotes for bleary barley
>scan bleary barley
That is a lot of matching for six letters. And you haven't seen anything like the brown before. You're pretty sure. But if you forgot what Elmo said, you can probably guess.

#forceignore

Your score has just gone up by one point

Burnt Brunt

#mistake test for deltaic
>deltaic
Reorganizing the geography around the Edictal Citadel won't help.

#nudge for citadel
>citadle
The whole Citadel? No, you couldn't do much with it at full strength. Maybe you can surprise Elvira in there, with help and your powers back. Plus, Elvira checked to make sure you couldn't do anything drastic to the Citadel.
#mistake test for end u
>end u
No, end *U*!
joke death
>undo
#mistake test for dialect
>dialect
No, a particular accent or odd word won't destroy the Edictal Citadel. Elvira checked off on all that.
#done rejects for nude dune
>blarey
You've dealt with the barley. You can move around a lot more, now.
#nudge for ly
>yl
Yup, that's the idea here in Otters.

#mistake test for increds

You marvel at the possible power of the cinders and even see red at the thought of giving them up.
#nudge for burtn

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for dune

You'll need to change more than one cinder.

#nudge for reedy

#spechelp for cinders

The cinders glow and even warm up for a bit.

/(Sr. Indec|NRD ICES|IC Nerds)
#scannotes for cinders

Hm, that's weird. Your sci-nerd side says perhaps there are two things you can do with the cinders, though it also sees red at the thought of giving them up entirely.

#nudge for steward
>stewadr
Hm, you only managed to deal with adverbs so far, and steward doesn't have an L or Y. Maybe look at him for clues? Remember his name?
#nudge for asteward
>astewadr
Hm, you only managed to deal with adverbs so far, and steward doesn't have an L or Y. Maybe look at him for clues? Remember his name?
#nudge for rye

The sandwich isn't just deli, or rye, or a sandwich. It's deli rye.
#nudge for sandwich
>sandwihc
The sandwich isn't just deli, or rye, or a sandwich. It's deli rye.

#spechelp for ed riley
>reediyl
Ed Riley looks askance at his deli rye, as if it had some bad aftertaste. If only he said things less loudly, boomingly, startlingly...
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Ed Riley. That's a decent omen.
#mistake test for deli-rye-otters
>lied
You can't think of anything to lie about that would sucker Ed Riley. You try to tell him the people who gave him this "job" lied but realize he doesn't know who you are.
#mistake test for reedy

No, the adverb.

The sea cube is unmoved. You may need to concentrate on the whole thing.
#spechelp for sea cube
>sea cueb
The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: while some words are rather long, you probably see how to guess a letter or two even when you've got your powers back.
>seacueb
The sea cube shakes a bit.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the sea cube. That's a decent omen.
