Strip of Profits
>throes
No, you are not in your last throes. Neither is Yorpwald. Try thinking of a more common word.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-storer
>storre
The resort and Store R led to the Means Manse last game. It won't go anywhere new, and you don't need or want to go back, right now.

>stoer
You'll want to focus on a specific store.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-storea

#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-storef
>storfe
That was soooo last game! Not that Shuffling Around was lame. I mean, I wrote it, and all. Just, I got even better at writing since then, and I wrote in newer awesomer adventures!

#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-storej

Nothing happens. The store remains impassive and dark. It doesn't look worth meddling with, anyway.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-storex

>storle
You search for a magic word but feel, er, lost.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-storeo
>storoe
Nothing happens. You consider going through the other 358 possibilities, but that'd be so rote.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-storeq
>storqe
Nothing happens. You didn't really expect it to since, hey, no u with the q.
#+ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-storer
>storre
The resort and Store R led to the Means Manse last game. It won't go anywhere new, and you don't need or want to go back, right now. You wouldn't be safe there.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-strip
>strpi
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-profits
>profist
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-profit

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-montage
>montaeg
It's probably counterproductive to change--it's more an information booth.
>x montage
Also, the montage was created by Tom Egan. Of course. Can't say he was not game.
>x montage
!Also, the montage was created by Tom Egan. Of course. Can't say he was not game.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-engraving
>engravign
The engraving is meant to be read. You can modify it with other actions.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-engravings
>engravinsg
You can only change the enrgavings by working through the other stores.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-patcher
>purloin patcher
>patchre
The patcher doesn't need to be changed. It does the changing if you point it.
>undo
>undo
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-someone
>someoen
Nothing happens. The engravings on the montage stay as they are. You probably need to worry about the stores and/or what they become, instead.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-nouned
>nounde
Nothing happens. The engravings on the montage stay as they are. You probably need to worry about the stores and/or what they become, instead.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-window
>windwo
Sadly, trying to change the windows wouldn't actually change the stores enough to find somewhere new.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-windows
>windosw
Sadly, trying to change the windows wouldn't actually change the stores enough to find somewhere new.
#mistake test for ergots
>ergots
You're trying to rescue the people of Yorpwald, not give them fungus infections.
#mistake test for gorest/go rest
>gorest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
>go rest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
#mistake test for gots er
>gots er
And what would you do with Store G, when you take it?
#mistake test for hoster
>hoster
That was sort of a given from the warning on Store H, and it is all in red. So none of those letters are in place. Hmm, what's a place/person that's been isolated?
>x store h
>hoster
That was sort of a given from the warning on Store H, as you note E. S. Roth's signature, and it is all in red. So none of those letters are in place. Hmm, what's a place/person that's been isolated?
#mistake test for ektor/ektors
>ektor
There's only one Ektor Mastiff, and to find him, you'd need to visit Marco Innocenti's most un-cyanotic Andromeda Collection.
>ektors
There's only one Ektor Mastiff, and to find him, you'd need to visit Marco Innocenti's most un-cyanotic Andromeda Collection.
#mistake test for ouster
>ouster
It's your job to be the ouster in Store U, but you'll need to warp out of the Strip.
#mistake test for pteros
>pteros
You don't need to face any predators. Aigh!
#mistake test for repost
>repost
That's not what you need to do with Store P--you even see red trying to figure HOW you would.
#mistake test for resort
>resort
You can't go back to the Means Manse. Well, you can, but it's a bad idea.
#mistake test for restow
>restow
Store W glows red as you try this.
#mistake test for sportif
>sportif
You can argue whether the strip is already sportif, but nonetheless, that would be a superficial change compared to fixing what's behind the stores.
#mistake test for stoner
>stoner
"Hey, man! Don't depersonalize me! Or I'll throw something at you!" you hear from inside Store N.
>stoner
"Like, don't do it again, dude, or I will literally totally throw these empty bottles at you."
>stoner
The door to Store N opens, and two bottles whizz in your direction but nowhere close. They're bright red, and they appear to be lotions or something.
>stoner
You've teased the person in Store N enough. You should have enough clues to figure his name now, anyway.
#mistake test for storge
>storge
You have a momentary vision of an apocryphal eighth book in the Harry Potter series sitting by a pillar, but it passes.
>storge
Stop trying to make Pillar of Storge happen.
#mistake test for stroke
>stroke
You need a stroke of genius, but that's all wrong. You are left seeing red a bit. But this puzzle probably isn't worth risking your health over.
#mistake test for sureto/sure to
>sureto
You'll be sure to figure it out sooner or later. You see red a bit at not quite being there yet.
>sure to
You'll be sure to figure it out sooner or later. You see red a bit at not quite being there yet.
#mistake retest for throes
>throes
No, you are not in your last throes. Neither is Yorpwald. Try looking at stores at the other end of the alphabet.
#mistake test for tosher
>tosher
Insults will get you nowhere. You see red at thinking such a word.
#mistake test for toyers
>toyers
You see red at the possibility people might mess with your mind in whatever's behind store Y--especially after noting the TOYERS with the red line through in the window.
#mistake test for troyes
>troyes
Store Y does not lead to France.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-shell
>shell
The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue of what Store Y can become.
#ttc-table-of-strip-of-profits-nudges-shells
>shelsl
The shells don't move. Perhaps they are just a clue of what Store Y can become.

#ttc-table-of-stores-spechelp-store-b

#ttc-table-of-stores-nudges-storse

Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#ttc-table-of-cruelest-lectures-nudges-seating

That might cause a bit too much commotion. Maybe you can pay attention to a common thread that will dispose of the blabber babbler and the Rehabs Basher.
#ttc-table-of-cruelest-lectures-nudges-mangiets
>mangiest
You can't see the way high highway any more. You're stuck dealing with the Rehabs Basher and blabber babbler. Tedious.

DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Suit Ode: Douse It. That's a decent omen.
