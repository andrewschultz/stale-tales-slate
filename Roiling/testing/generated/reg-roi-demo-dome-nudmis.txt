There's nothing too tricky to do in the Demo Dome. You can THINK or request the SCORE to see if there's anything you missed. VERBS has limited utility, since there are no puzzles here.
!You already saw a singed design when you helped Curtis. Plus, arson is bad.

/^Evoc-Cove
A welcoming place full of feeling and peace and weird new ideas that it's just good to know are there. A novella is propped up against the wall by some invisible force. You can go back west if you want.
