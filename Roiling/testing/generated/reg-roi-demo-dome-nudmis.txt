#mistake test for singed

There's nothing too tricky to do in the Demo Dome. You can THINK or request the SCORE to see if there's anything you missed. VERBS has limited utility, since there are no puzzles here.

You can't get near the shall halls, although you still have the nonmagical ability to change the future. Well, some day you will.

#nudge for demo

Maybe in another game, you could do that, if you walked around right. But not this one.

Evoc-Cove
A welcoming place full of feeling and peace and weird new ideas that it's just good to know are there. A novella is propped up against the wall by some invisible force. You can go back west if you want.

Sparse Spares

>u

>score
You could still examine the parcels clasper in Sparse Spares.

>s
You take a break, ignoring the parcels clasper in Sparse Spares, and get back to, well, running Yorpwald. The museum was about the right size. Not too small, but not so big it wasted taxpayers' money.
