#no table entry for dusty-study: nowhere-ing is too complex, so it's in check going nowhere in Dusty Study
>e
You're just in the mood for quiet time, now, just looking around

#verbcase sleep-ordeal-reload-if-player-is-in-dusty-study-and-report-porter-perrot-is-off-stage
>sleep
But you just woke up!
#verbcase listen-ordeal-reload-if-player-is-in-dusty-study-if-stuff-found-<-3
>listen
Peace and quiet. No adventure. Yet.

#testcase-outside-dusty-study
>exit
You haven't made a way outside the Dusty Study. But one does exist. More than one. You just hid them a bit, so only your powers can activate them.

#testcase-exits-dusty-study
>exits
You feel trapped right now, and you know if you stay here too long, you'll be apprehended. It's as if you need that kick to tell you, yes, you need to get on with things and take your chances.

>think
You begin a deep think, all about Elvira's rise to prominence and how she assured everyone that she could do wordplay if she were bored, and she was sure it was the best you could do, but really, there was no CREATIVITY at the heart of it, just calculation--and that tagged gadget to give clues was a bit TOO convenient. It passes the time, feeling upset.

Whoah! Bangish bashing at the isolani liaison!

That worked in Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but not here. That'd be copy-catting.

Thankfully, this is a game about anagrams and not spoonerisms, and you cleaned the tables before flipping them, so you smell no table scrap.

Dialogue is more important right now than action. Elmo is here to help you at great personal risk, and if you poked around, it'd mean less time for him to escape.
You can RECAP to see your options.

Elmo checks you for a second. "You sure you know how to use the settler?"
You nod. "No clues counsel."
