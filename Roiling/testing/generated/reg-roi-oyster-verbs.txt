You just got here, so direction means nothing. So you can only really go out, but those LOLstr trolls will just coax you back inside. Unless you can out-cool them

#testcase-outside-posh-hops-shop

The jukebox notches technos (though a mere six remixes) with an anti-bore iron beat. Rap is par, too. The pesty types would be upset if something happened.

!Silence. Awkward silence. An occasional cough.
