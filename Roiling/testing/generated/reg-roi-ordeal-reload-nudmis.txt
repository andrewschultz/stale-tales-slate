#nudge for ordeal
>ordela
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#mistake test for walkthrough/walkthru
>walkthrough
You can HINT an individual thing or ask for a general HINT. There is also a walkthrough.txt that should've come with the game. It should be linked to at IFDB or somewhere.

#mistake test for use [text]
>use zozimus
The verb USE is a bit too nonspecific for the parser. You can SWITCH things, or OPEN doors
>purloin settler
#mistake test for knock [text]
>knock zozimus
Just KNOCK instead.
#mistake test for hug [text]/hug
>hug zozimus
Hug? Ugh. Guh.

You can CONSULT PAD ABOUT X, CONSULT ABOUT X, or PAD X.
#nudge for study
>stuyd
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#mistake test for nip
>nip
Maybe if it weren't a giant pin. Well, giant enough to hide a wall safe.
#mistake test for odor
>odor
You'd stink as a host, trying that.
#mistake test for rood
>rood
No need to surprise a guest like that. Just open the door.
#nudge for manse
>manes
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for chair
>chari
The chair is built too sturdily to be changed into anything else. You made sure of that when you bought it, for practical reasons. You can't make it more or less hi-arc, either. But it's still soft enough to be relaxing.
#nudge for rich
>rihc
The chair may be an unnecessary luxury, but you shouldn't feel bad about that.
#nudge for niche
>niceh
It's not any old niche. It's your niche. And by your niche, I mean you see it as "my niche."
>get notepad
Good choice taking the notepad. It'll help you tame lots that's meta, mate.
Taking the pedanto-notepad uncovered some sad ads on the chair.
#nudge for sad
>sda
The ads have probably gone through enough word-twisting.
#mistake test for [text] stable [text]/stable [text]/[text] stable

#nudge for rove

That's not a way to sneak around and avoid the knock at the door.

#mistake test for laredo

If you want a Western game situated on the US/Mexico border, this isn't for you.

#nudge for dark

You punch your fist as you realize DARK has no anagrams...right into the palm.
>dakr
Oh no, not again. Concentrate on the palm.
#nudge for darkness
>darkness
Oh no, not again. Concentrate on the palm.
#renudge for rove
>roev
That's not a way to sneak around and avoid any future knock at the door.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-palm
>lapm
You think you feel the palm shake a bit, but nothing terribly magical happens.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the palm. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-latches
>satchle
You think you feel static through the latches. But they remain the same. Maybe there's some easy way to change them.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the latches. That's a decent omen.
#mistake test for chalets
>chalets
You don't need a safe home, right now. You need adventure. Oh, and you don't have to switch that many letters, either.
#nudge for latch
>lathc
Not one latch. All of them.

>satchel
Your score has just gone up by one point.
>t

#nudge for notice
>notiec
You can flip everything on the diorama except the notice.
#nudge for diorama
>dioraam
Gateman Nat Egam assured you you couldn't change it by accident when he gave it to you. The stuff hanging from it, though...
>x dope
The dope op-ed is broken into several pages. It's by Elvira, and it's apparently tackling you on your own ground. The pages are labeled nitro-intro, questin' inquest, MoneyCo and Economy, Shatter-Threats, I Trash His Art, and By Li'l Billy.
#nudge for gape
>gaep
You feel like you physically want to crumple up the page, but you just stare blankly at it.
#nudge for nitro
>nitor
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.
#nudge for questin

>bilyl
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.
#nudge for oped

You're not going to change this--deed. Or Elvira's opinion. Better to change Yorpwald.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-scannotes-tables

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-scannotes-meet-bans
>scan meet bans
You fiddle with the cheat button. The eighth entry turns purple with cheats on, red with them off.
#mistake test for palm
>palm
Maybe you could, but you will need the light. You won't need the landscaping.
#done rejects for lamp
>lapm
If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.
#mistake retest for odor
>odor
The smell would gag you before the shouty youths.
#mistake retest for rood
>rood
It'd be your own crucifix if you let the shouty youths outside in.
#mistake test for pedo
>pedo
Yep. It's probably part of Elvira's reject-and-retreat, insinuating something without proving it. One of her "clever" games.
>pedo
Don't dwell on it. It's lies.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-meet-bans
>basemetn
The ten beams creak slightly. Maybe not all of them. But a few.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the MEET-BANS. That's a decent omen.
#mistake test for net/net beams/beams net

#mistake test for best name/bestname

Hm, you're pretty sure the beams guard something below. What's the best name for a room that's below? (You note the first and third squares on your settler turn purple as you think of the best name.)
>bestname
Hm, you're pretty sure the beams guard something below. What's the best name for a room that's below? (You note the first and third squares on your settler turn purple as you think of the best name.)
#nudge for beams
>beasm
Not even one of the beams rattles. You count them up again--there are ten.
#nudge for ten
>tne
You change neither the number nor the makeup of the ten beams.

>basement
Now you remember why there were ten beams. Of course, the ten beams lead down to what must be a basement, even if it's called something different.
Your score has just gone up by two points
>score

#nudge for table
>tabel
A bleat: "tableS!"
#nudge for subpoena
>subpoean
Subpoenas are subpoenas. The law is the law. You don't know any lawyers good enough to wiggle out with THEIR form of word-twisting.

Hm, no, the niche--my niche--won't unfold that way.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from MY NICHE. That's a decent omen.
#nudge for ceiling

You wouldn't want to collapse the whole ceiling, but maybe the words MY NICHE could be changed.

>score
Score in a scenario: 6 out of 15 total points in the current region, Ordeal Reload. Lowest score to solve is 10. Maximum score available is 15.

#done rejects for chimney
>chimnye
You probably just want to go UP the chimney.

#nudge for isolani
>isolain
You don't need to rearrange the isolani liaison. It's all that protects you from the outside world.
#nudge for pin
>pni
It's one big giant pin.
#nudge for giant
>giatn
It's one big giant pin.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-giant-pin

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-readables-giant-pin

GNAT. I NIP is nonsensically written in red on the giant pin.
#nudge for bowling

It's more that it's a giant pin and not, like, a safety pin.
#nudge for bowlingpin
>bowlingpni
It's more that it's a giant pin and not, like, a safety pin.
#nudge for bookshelf
>bookshefl
The bookshelf is too massively immovable. If you could magick it, all those books would probably create an avalanche, anyway.
#nudge for books

The books could use some changing. But you're better off making Yorpwald itself safe for art, good or bad, first.

Score in a scenario: 7 out of 15 total points in the current region, Ordeal Reload. Lowest score to solve is 11. Maximum score available is 15.

#nudge for abstract
>abstratc
That is probably overthinking the painting's abstract-ness. It's really just good for examining.
#done rejects for painting
>paintign
The painting really goes better with the study than the giant pin.
#mistake retest for chalets

#mistake retest for chalets
>chalets
You don't need a safe home, right now. You need adventure.
!that many letters
#done rejects for letters settler
>satchle
Tinkering with the satchel, wherever it's gone, would not be helpful. The super purse is big enough, and you don't want to do anything that might damage the letters settler.

Oh, right. You bought it from Trisa Israt.
#mistake test for astir

You need to change that to something else, then it'll be astir.
#nudge for framing

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for ridging

If you collapsed the girding ridging, which you can't, the shouty youths would hear something and be after you.

!DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the event map. That's a decent omen.

Hm... "retrain terrain" is a bit circular, as anagrams go. The plaster psalter and palest pastel plates probably hold the key to leaving.

Ok, the Carven Cavern IS pretty craven as anagrams go, but you need to find a way through, no matter what its name is.

You're on your own. Perhaps you'd be better off scanning the plaster and twiddling the plates to get on with things.

>stapel
The plates shine slightly and rattle.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the palest pastel plates. That's a decent omen.

Hmm, maybe the question mark isn't as vague as you're worried it is.

That's already been done, and quite well, by Alan Garner in The Owl Service. If you haven't read his Brisingamen books, you should! They're not too long and very entertaining.

#renudge for terrain
>terrani
Hm... "retrain terrain" is a bit circular, as anagrams go. The plaster psalter and staple probably hold the key to leaving.

Those plates were a mess, and now they're a tidy staple. It's better that way.

The plaster was cracking anyway, before you made it a shiny stapler. You don't need to change it again.

"Spelling matters, here. If I were a spectre, I'd give a different cheat reading. Slots six and seven would turn yellow and red, respectfully. Err, respectively," says the Respect Specter.
You're not sure how it was able to detect your mental spelling, but you're a bit impressed and worried at the same time.
