>ordela
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-walkthrough-walkthru
>walkthrough
You can HINT an individual thing or ask for a general HINT. There is also a walkthrough.txt that should've come with the game. It should be linked to at IFDB or somewhere.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-use-text
>use zozimus
The verb USE is a bit too nonspecific for the parser. You can SWITCH things, or OPEN doors

>purloin settler

#testcase-mistake-roiling-consult-text
>consult zozimus
It looks like you tried to consult your notepad about something. The proper syntax is CONSULT PAD ABOUT X, CONSULT ABOUT X, or PAD X.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-knock-text
>undo

>knock zozimus
Just KNOCK instead.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-hug-text-hug

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-study
>stuyd
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-nip
>nip
Maybe if it weren't a giant pin. Well, giant enough to hide a wall safe.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-odor
>odor
You'd stink as a host, trying that.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-rood
>rood
No need to surprise a guest like that. Just open the door.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-nudges-manse
>manes
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-chair
>chari
The chair is built too sturdily to be changed into anything else. You made sure of that when you bought it, for practical reasons. You can't make it more or less hi-arc, either. But it's still soft enough to be relaxing.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-rich
>rihc
The chair may be an unnecessary luxury, but you shouldn't feel bad about that.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-niche
>niceh
It's not any old niche. It's your niche. And by your niche, I mean you see it as "my niche."

>get notepad
Good choice taking the notepad. It'll help you tame lots that's meta, mate.
Taking the pedanto-notepad uncovered some sad ads on the chair.

#mistake retest for consult [text]
>consult zozimus
You can CONSULT PAD ABOUT X, CONSULT ABOUT X, or PAD X.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-sad
>sda
The ads have probably gone through enough word-twisting.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-text-stable-text-stable-text-text-stable

You can just change the tables by saying STABLE--well, once you've had an introductory dialogue with an NPC.

You can just change the tables by saying STABLE--well, once you've had an introductory dialogue with an NPC.
>zozimus stable
You can just change the tables by saying STABLE--well, once you've had an introductory dialogue with an NPC.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-ablest
>ablest
No, it's a thing you can change the tables to. You didn't have to deal with adjectives in Shuffling Around, but maybe you will here, later. Much later.

>think
You begin a deep think, all about Elvira's rise to prominence and how she assured everyone that she could do wordplay if she were bored, and she was sure it was the best you could do, but really, there was no CREATIVITY at the heart of it, just calculation--and that tagged gadget to give clues was a bit TOO convenient. It passes the time, feeling upset.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-rove

That's not a way to sneak around and avoid the knock at the door.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-laredo
>laredo
If you want a Western game situated on the US/Mexico border, this isn't for you.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-dark

You punch your fist as you realize DARK has no anagrams...right into the palm.
>dakr
Oh no, not again. Concentrate on the palm.

That's not a way to sneak around and avoid any future knock at the door.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-palm
>lapm
You think you feel the palm shake a bit, but nothing terribly magical happens.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the palm. That's a decent omen.

>banish settler

You think you feel static through the latches. But they remain the same. Maybe there's some easy way to change them.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the latches. That's a decent omen.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-chalets

You don't need a safe home, right now. You need adventure. Oh, and you don't have to switch that many letters, either.

Not one latch. All of them.

>satchel

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-notice
>notiec
You can flip everything on the diorama except the notice.
#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-diorama
>dioraam
Gateman Nat Egam assured you you couldn't change it by accident when he gave it to you. The stuff hanging from it, though...
>x dope
The dope op-ed is broken into several pages. It's by Elvira, and it's apparently tackling you on your own ground. The pages are labeled nitro-intro, questin' inquest, MoneyCo and Economy, Shatter-Threats, I Trash His Art, and By Li'l Billy.
#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-gape
>gaep
You feel like you physically want to crumple up the page, but you just stare blankly at it.
#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-nitro
>nitor
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.
#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-questin

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-oped
>opde
You're not going to change this--deed. Or Elvira's opinion. Better to change Yorpwald.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-scannotes-tables

You fiddle with the cheat button and note that nothing happens to the reds and yellows

You fiddle with the cheat button. The eighth entry turns purple with cheats on, red with them off.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-palm
>palm
Maybe you could, but you will need the light. You won't need the landscaping.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-done-rejects-lamp
>lapm
If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.
#mistake retest for odor
>odor
The smell would gag you before the shouty youths.
#mistake retest for rood
>rood
It'd be your own crucifix if you let the shouty youths outside in.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-pedo
>pedo
Yep. It's probably part of Elvira's reject-and-retreat, insinuating something without proving it. One of her "clever" games.
>pedo
Don't dwell on it. It's lies.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-meet-bans
>basemetn
The ten beams creak slightly. Maybe not all of them. But a few.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the MEET-BANS. That's a decent omen.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-best-name-bestname

Hm, you're pretty sure the beams guard something below. What's the best name for a room that's below? (You note the first and third squares on your settler turn purple as you think of the best name.)
>bestname
Hm, you're pretty sure the beams guard something below. What's the best name for a room that's below? (You note the first and third squares on your settler turn purple as you think of the best name.)
#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-beams
>beasm
Not even one of the beams rattles. You count them up again--there are ten.
#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-ten
>tne
You change neither the number nor the makeup of the ten beams.

>basement
Now you remember why there were ten beams. Of course, the ten beams lead down to what must be a basement, even if it's called something different.
Your score has just gone up by two points

A bleat: "tableS!"
#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-subpoena

Subpoenas are subpoenas. The law is the law. You don't know any lawyers good enough to wiggle out with THEIR form of word-twisting.

You probably just want to go UP the chimney.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-isolani

The pin wobbles.

GNAT. I NIP is nonsensically written in red on the giant pin.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-bookshelf
>bookshefl
The bookshelf is too massively immovable. If you could magick it, all those books would probably create an avalanche, anyway.
#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-books

The books could use some changing. But you're better off making Yorpwald itself safe for art, good or bad, first.

#ttc-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-abstract

That is probably overthinking the painting's abstract-ness. It's really just good for examining.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-done-rejects-painting

The painting really goes better with the study than the giant pin.

Dusty Study
>event mpa
The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works, though some of the diorama's contrived examples have spaces.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: You need to change certain things to other things.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-pavement
>event mpa
Hmm. Nah. That's not quite it. Your skills are a bit rusty, but you'll figure it out. Or you can examine the diorama.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the pavement. That's a decent omen.

The pavement unfolds into a small map which, you remember, describes your first trip through Yorpwald.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-platform

Hmm. Nah. That's not quite it. Your skills are a bit rusty, but you'll figure it out. Or you can examine the diorama.

>steel pad

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-crabgrass
>brass crga
Hmm. Nah. That's not quite it. Your skills are a bit rusty, but you'll figure it out. Or you can examine the diorama.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the crabgrass. That's a decent omen.
>x diorama
>brass crga
Hmm. Nah. That's not quite it. Your skills are a bit rusty, but you'll figure it out. Or you can reexamine the diorama.
>brass crag
The crabgrass dries out and becomes a brass crag.

#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-event-map
>pavemetn
You know what to change the event map back to: the pavement. There's no third option.
!DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the event map. That's a decent omen.
>pavement
The event map folds back into a thoroughly more dull pavement. Reading the notice briefly, you see that things won't be this flexible out in the real world.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-brass-crag
>crabgrssa
You know what to change the brass crag back to: the crabgrass. There's no third option.

>flire
Elmo bobbles the rifle slightly, and you think he may've nodded encouragement at you.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the rifle. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-readables-rifle

It's kind of tricky to read red writing on a red gun, but it appears to be an Irelf-Efril rifle.

You can't just give Elmo a desk job. Though maybe some paperwork would help.

You start to educate Elmo about the penalties for murder, but he gestures at you like you've almost guessed a Charades clue or something.

You can't change Elmo into an animal. Your powers don't work that way. But maybe he is a different sort of mole.

Elmo checks you for a second. "You sure you know how to use the settler?"
You nod. "No clues counsel."

The respect specter shrugs respectfully. "A deferred success."

#ttc-table-of-carven-cavern-nudges-cavern
>cavenr
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#ttc-table-of-carven-cavern-nudges-terrain
>terrani
Hm... "retrain terrain" is a bit circular, as anagrams go. The plaster psalter and palest pastel plates probably hold the key to leaving.
#ttc-table-of-carven-cavern-nudges-plate

You have no idea which plate to focus on, so maybe you should focus on the plates.

Ok, the Carven Cavern IS pretty craven as anagrams go, but you need to find a way through, no matter what its name is.

You're on your own. Perhaps you'd be better off scanning the plaster and twiddling the plates to get on with things.
#ttc-table-of-ordeal-reload-spechelp-plates

The plates shine slightly and rattle.

Nothing happens. You probably don't need to anagram the apertured departure, which is a relief, since it's nine letters long, and that's a lot. Maybe a more manual solution works.

The plaster was cracking anyway, before you made it a shiny stapler. You don't need to change it again.

"Spelling matters, here. If I were a spectre, I'd give a different cheat reading. Slots six and seven would turn yellow and red, respectfully. Err, respectively," says the Respect Specter.
