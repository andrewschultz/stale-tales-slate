#testcase-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-chair
>chari
The chair is built too sturdily to be changed into anything else. You made sure of that when you bought it, for practical reasons. You can't make it more or less hi-arc, either. But it's still soft enough to be relaxing.

#testcase-table-of-dusty-study-nudges-niche

No, it's a thing you can change the tables to. You didn't have to deal with adjectives in Shuffling Around, but maybe you will here, later. Much later.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-bleats
>bleats
Bleats might be too abstract to help you.

>think
You begin a deep think, all about Elvira's rise to prominence and how she assured everyone that she could do wordplay if she were bored, and she was sure it was the best you could do, but really, there was no CREATIVITY at the heart of it, just calculation--and that tagged gadget to give clues was a bit TOO convenient. It passes the time, feeling upset.

That's not a way to sneak around and avoid the knock at the door.

>event mpa
The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works, though some of the diorama's contrived examples have spaces.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: You need to change certain things to other things.

Gateman Nat Egam assured you you couldn't change it by accident when he gave it to you. The stuff hanging from it, though...
>x dope
The dope op-ed is broken into several pages. It's by Elvira, and it's apparently tackling you on your own ground. The pages are labeled nitro-intro, questin' inquest, MoneyCo and Economy, Shatter-Threats, I Trash His Art, and By Li'l Billy.
