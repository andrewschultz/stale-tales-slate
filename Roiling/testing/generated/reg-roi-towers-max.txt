Loftier Trefoil

The palace--well, you couldn't even see it before you stepped in here. Maybe someone will help you, once you've sorted this mess out.

#pre-rodney rule
>yonder
Your attempt to bounce Rodney yonder is blocked by a few of his followers, who stumble a bit but stay upright as they combat the invisible force sucking him away. That looked like the right idea, but maybe get rid of a few of them, first?

Rodney can be sent YONDER once he's lost enough followers.
>droney
Rodney's voice would certainly seem droney by itself, but he segues into a marching song. I guess when you're a leader, you have that confidence. Maybe diminish his forces?

Ornate Atoner Renato told you that the people guarding passage would be tough. Like, six or more letters tough. But you might be able to listen to them and talk to them. He also mentioned Dr. Yow, whom you haven't found yet, and how the top opt pot was for...well, someone Renato was sad to have lost touch with.

#ttc-table-of-castle-approaching-narratives-2
The palace seems a bit closer now. You probably have a way to go, but it's a start. Maybe the Spec-O-Scope could provide some sort of map. And those three guardians--well, maybe you can bribe, attack or talk to them. For information if nothing else. The bluster butlers, particularly, keep their eyes on you. Maybe they're guarding something important.
