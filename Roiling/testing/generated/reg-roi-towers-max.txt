#pre-rodney rule
>yonder
Your attempt to bounce Rodney yonder is blocked by a few of his followers, who stumble a bit but stay upright as they combat the invisible force sucking him away. That looked like the right idea, but maybe get rid of a few of them, first?
!by one point
#preefcheck rodney
>pf
Rodney can be sent YONDER.
>droney
Rodney's voice would certainly seem droney by itself, but he segues into a marching song. I guess when you're a leader, you have that confidence. Maybe diminish his forces?
!by one point
#preefcheck rodney retry
>pf
Rodney can be sent YONDER or made DRONEY.

#pre-fussier rule

The fissure squirms a bit but settles back down. When it was open, maybe something could've gone in, but you're carrying nothing close to the right shape.

#pre-unlocked rule

You fiddle with the prison ropins but probably need someone or something to MAKE them unlocked due to how they're configured. You don't have anything on you. Then, UNLOCKED should work. It just feels right.
