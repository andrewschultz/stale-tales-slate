Grey Gyre

#spechelp for maze walls
>veltamoz
The volt maze rumbles a bit. You must have all the right letters to bring it crashing down in style.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the volt maze. That's a decent omen.
#spechelp for lamb
>blma
The lamb looks confused. Maybe you could be more forceful. Verbally, not physically.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the lamb. That's a decent omen.
#mistake test for balm
>balm
Giving the lamb balm might be an option, if there was any in the game, but turning it into balm would be out of line. And it wouldn't scare the lamb home.
#mistake test for enemy tzar/tzar enemy
>enemy tzar
You hear a rumbling. Then Elvira appears from the maze! "Oh, dear, this will be easy," she says. And it is.
joke death

#nudge for volt
>votl
That can't be it. It's more than a volt: a VOLT MAZE.
#nudge for maze
>maez
That can't be it. It's more than a maze: a VOLT MAZE.
#nudge for storep
>storpe
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for crust
>cruts
You shouldn't play with your food. Yes, even if it is less traumatic to play with than to eat.
#nudge for grye
>grey
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for entry
>entyr
It's the maze you need to change, not the zany meter.
#nudge for mazeentry

It's the maze you need to change, not the zany meter.

#spechelp for hump
>umhp
The hump suddenly looks a bit smaller. But not enough.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the hump. That's a decent omen.
#mistake test for hm up/up hm
>hm up
You don't need to levitate the hump. You need a way to jump over it.
>up hm
You don't need to levitate the hump. You need a way to jump over it.

Austerer Treasure

>score
Score in a scenario: 1 out of 41 total points in the current region, Presto. Lowest score to solve is 28. Maximum score available is 41.

#mistake test for ooph/phoo
>ooph
That sounds almost like the sort of grunt that would help you reach the hoop, but it doesn't quite work.
>phoo
That sounds almost like the sort of grunt that would help you reach the hoop, but it doesn't quite work.
#mistake test for pheyoo
>pheyoo
But nothing really smells in here. Perhaps you need something more straightforward and universal.
#nudge for austerer
>austerre
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#spechelp for ye hoop
>phooye
The hoop dips a bit as if to taunt you.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Ye Hoop. That's a decent omen.
#respechelp for ye hoop

The hoop dips a bit as if to taunt you.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Ye Hoop. That's a decent omen.

#mistake test for bleep
>bleep
I don't know what you said, but it's vulgar, I'm sure. Doesn't faze ME, though.
#mistake test for rats
>rats
Boy! It'd be neat to have something that made you more authoritative.
#mistake test for whassup
>whassup
You probably want to TALK to people instead. Well, most of the time.

>phooey
Your score has just gone up by two points
>score
Score in a scenario: 3 out of 41 total points in the current region, Presto. Lowest score to solve is 29. Maximum score available is 41.

#nudge for earring

The earring pulses a bit more, but you doubt you can do anything with it on your own.

Score in a scenario: 3 out of 41 total points in the current region, Presto. Lowest score to solve is 29. Maximum score available is 41.

#nudges for earring
>rreagin
The earring pulses a bit more, but you doubt you can do anything with it on your own.

#mistake test for rangier/rearing
>rangier
The earring shakes a bit more than usual, but maybe you're not in an area where it can be itself, or what it needs to be, yet.
>rearing
The earring shakes a bit more than usual, but maybe you're not in an area where it can be itself, or what it needs to be, yet.

#nudge for hump
>umhp
You search for the hump you overcame. You can't find it now. But it's not relevant.

>s
Char Arch

#mistake test for tars
>tars
!But you already took the tsar star FROM the tars. Plus, you'd get all sticky.
#mistake test for a gps
>a gps
A GPS might point you to the gasp-gaps, but it wouldn't help you survive them. It wouldn't even help you if I forgot to list an exit elsewhere, which totally only happened in the first release and is fixed everywhere now, I hope.
#mistake test for cafe
>cafe
You don't need caffeine or food here.
#mistake test for gpa/gpas
>gpa
You're not being graded here. I mean, you are getting a score, but this isn't school or anything.
>gpas
You're not being graded here. I mean, you are getting a score, but this isn't school or anything.
#mistake test for kay
>kay
You try to nag the yak with a "kay?" but without the "mm" it's just not Lumberghian enough to work.
#mistake test for kya
>kya
The yak is unimpressed with your karate noises.
#mistake test for mad
>mad
How can you feel mad, looking at such a beautiful work of nature?
#mistake test for okey
>okey
You try to make things okey (sic) but you aren't enough of a bard to.
#mistake test for spag
>spag
You don't have time to read text-adventuring magazines right now. You're too busy living them.
#mistake test for srat
>srat
The Self-Referential Aptitude Test is an interesting puzzle, but you have enough on your mind, right now.
#mistake test for pga/pgas
>pga
No golfers appear.
>pgas
No golfers appear.
#nudge for char
>chra
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for cretin
>cretni
You won't change the cistern, but maybe you can track down the dart.
#nudge for cistern
>cistenr
You won't change the cistern, but maybe you can track down the dart.
#nudge for mad
>mda
Here in the Char Arch, you don't need to mess with the scenery. Especially scenery farther away and nicer looking than the cretins' cistern.
#nudge for maddam
>maddma
It looks like you tried to act on something doubly, possibly something that anagrams itself. To remove any future confusion, you should know you don't need to do that--though in the future, it does give a bonus point, for a special but odd word.
!Here in the

#nudge for gasp
>gaps
You try, but fail, to make something out of nothing.
#nudge for gpa
>pag
You try, but fail, to make something out of nothing.
>x cistern
You take a peek in--to see a dart in there.

#spechelp for dart
>drta
The dart seems a bit closer, but...dang! Not quite.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the dart. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-presto-readables-drab-yoke
>read drab yoke
It is, apparently, an OAK DERBY drab yoke, from the small red print.

#spechelp for tsar star
>rast
The tsar star seems to wiggle a bit, but not enough to pull it out.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the tsar star. That's a decent omen.
#nudge for tar
>tra
The tars remain heterogeneous. And very sticky. And the same size.
#mistake test for arts
>arts
Being an arts tsar won't help. You need a word that shows anger.
#mistake test for tard
>tard
Whether you are cursing the person who put the dart there, or yourself for not being able to get the dart, a slur like that isn't the way to go. In fact, it isn't the way to go in real life, either! A Roiling Original doesn't want to be THAT sort of juvenile.
You see red at your slight indiscretion
>tard
Instead of using that word again, you think back to why you saw red after thinking it, beyond being embarrassed. You need a four-letter word, but T, A, R and D are in the wrong place. You take the time to write out all 24 possibilities, noting only nine remaining ones are valid. And that's before you use the settler. You also remember some mumbo-jumbo about the inclusion-exclusion principle, and how a random configuration of N items in a set has about a 1-1/e chance of having none right.
You don't feel dumb after doing this, so there's really no need to use that word again. Not that there ever was.
>tard
You are just trolling now. No further clues for you.

#spechelp for plebe
>blepe
The plebe looks confused, as if you garbled what you said.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the plebe. That's a decent omen.

Marines Seminar Remains

#mistake test for oppugn [text]/oppugn
>oppugn zozimus
You question the popgun a bit, mentally, but it's all you've got. It really should come in handy somewhere. Every other weird thing you've found has.
>oppugn

#mistake test for nobig/no big

Overconfidence is sort of the way, here. But it needs to be backed up with an idea.
>no big
Overconfidence is sort of the way, here. But it needs to be backed up with an idea.
#mistake test for pilots
>pilots
You don't need to fly anywhere. Besides, it's a popgun, not a pistol.
#mistake test for smearin
>smearin
That may've happened during the seminar, but you don't need that sort of violence here and now.
#mistake test for strop
>strop
That's not the kind of weapon you need. You see red, slightly, at the prospect of cutting yourself with a razor strop by mistake.

#spechelp for boing

You try something that doesn't quite work, but now you're that much closer to an a-ha moment.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the boing-go bin. That's a decent omen.

Well! No matches, but the name is short enough, you might be able to eliminate things that clearly don't work. Then, eureka!

Maybe you can find where the vowel is. That could help.

#spechelp for sport ports

The sport ports seem even shinier for a second.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the sport ports. That's a decent omen.

TOP'RS is the name of the firm who built the Sport Ports, carved in red.

You already observed all the ports. No need to try to single one out.
#done rejects for sport ports

#ttc-table-of-presto-scannotes-n-t-air
>scan n-t-air
Hmm. Part of you thinks you could just deal with Nowt Town now--it can't be too hard. But part of you also wants to see if there's a way to deal with the whole volt maze.

#ttc-table-of-presto-scannotes-maze-walls

Whoa! You'd think, in Nowt Town, it'd only be four letters. But maybe there is a longer solution than that. It'd, like, give you more satisfaction or something. Maybe.
#nudge for mazeroom

The big L may be some sort of clue, but you can't do anything with it.

You'll need to be glib with something like g-lib later. If you get through this maze. In fact, maybe being glib might be easier than walking through.

It's alternately referred to as Drive E and E Drive. I'D VEER, someone has written in red.
#spechelp for tba key
>abt
The TBA key rattles within the keyboard a bit.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the TBA key. That's a decent omen.

#spechelp for drive a
>drivea
Hmm. Drive A coughs for a bit but doesn't really catch. It could be running more efficiently.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Drive A. That's a decent omen.
#spechelp for drive e
>drivee
Hmm. Drive E (the E drive) has something wrong with it. Maybe you can work things out, even if you don't know right away, but that's not it.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Drive E. That's a decent omen.
#mistake test for redive

But you've figured nothing about Drive E yet. Not that you strictly need to.

Since there's both Drive A and Drive E, that's ambiguous. You can still tweak Drive E, though.

#renudge for drive

Since there's both Drive A and Drive E, that's ambiguous. But it doesn't matter. You did what you could with both, anyway
#mistake retest for redive

Deriving was tricky enough.

You already did enough with the TAB key.

No, the TAB key is what it should be.

#spechelp for bub dude egg
>debgu
Hmm. Fixing code you've compiled is tricky. Once it's fixed, if you have even one thing in the wrong order, it does nothing right. That has to be what's happening here, why BUB DUDE EGG is showing.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from BUB DUDE EGG. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-presto-scannotes-bub-dude-egg
>scan bub dude egg
Only one color for sure? And you don't even get any clues from BUB DUDE EGG? Well, perhaps there is some detective work here.
#pre-bub-dude-egg rule retry
>debug
The process of debugging is going to take a while. You will need some sort of energy. That ALocalCo Cola won't quite be enough for the task ahead, as-is.

Wait. Maybe you don't need to scan anything with the settler. You remember you've already figured what to do, here, just not when. The information's in your pedanto-notepad.

#nudge for local
>locla
The cola has already been reprocessed enough. You'll drink it when the time comes.

>pour cola in mug
You drain the ALocalCo cola bottle. It fills the mug, and you take a tiny sip. The liquid level refills after a minute. It tastes like car fuel, which makes you careful--and hopeful for a far clue. You feel more inspired and calmer than if you'd tried Loco-Alca or Loca-Alco, and your mind's clear enough, you finally see the right way to use a co-alloc. A recycling trap door makes a noise, and you pitch the empty cola bottle into it absent-mindedly.
The Be-Troo E-Robot, from under the labs slab, clicks reprovingly. Probably because it's a bot o' root beer.

#redone rejects for mug
>mgu
You'd get cola all over you if you tried anything with the mug.
#nudge for lcao
>lcoa
The mug is already somehow generating infinite cola. Don't want to mess with that.

Hm, USB seems pretty straightforward. Maybe there are two solutions, each equally good.

#spechelp for usb

Hmm. There are only five possibilities, and more than one may be right. You've done the tough stuff.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the USB. That's a decent omen.
