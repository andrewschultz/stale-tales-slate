#ttc-table-of-presto-spechelp-maze-walls
>veltamoz
The volt maze rumbles a bit. You must have all the right letters to bring it crashing down in style.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the volt maze. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-presto-spechelp-lamb
>blma
The lamb looks confused. Maybe you could be more forceful. Verbally, not physically.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the lamb. That's a decent omen.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-balm
>balm
Giving the lamb balm might be an option, if there was any in the game, but turning it into balm would be out of line. And it wouldn't scare the lamb home.

You hear a rumbling. Then Elvira appears from the maze! "Oh, dear, this will be easy," she says. And it is.

Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

You shouldn't play with your food. Yes, even if it is less traumatic to play with than to eat.

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.

The hump suddenly looks a bit smaller. But not enough.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the hump. That's a decent omen.

You don't need to levitate the hump. You need a way to jump over it.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-tars

!But you already took the tsar star FROM the tars. Plus, you'd get all sticky.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-a-gps

A GPS might point you to the gasp-gaps, but it wouldn't help you survive them. It wouldn't even help you if I forgot to list an exit elsewhere, which totally only happened in the first release and is fixed everywhere now, I hope.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-cafe

You don't need caffeine or food here.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-kay

You try to nag the yak with a "kay?" but without the "mm" it's just not Lumberghian enough to work.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-kya

The yak is unimpressed with your karate noises.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-mad

How can you feel mad, looking at such a beautiful work of nature?
#testcase-mistake-roiling-okey
>okey
You try to make things okey (sic) but you aren't enough of a bard to.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-spag
>spag
You don't have time to read text-adventuring magazines right now. You're too busy living them.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-srat

The Self-Referential Aptitude Test is an interesting puzzle, but you have enough on your mind, right now.

It looks like you tried to act on something doubly, possibly something that anagrams itself. To remove any future confusion, you should know you don't need to do that--though in the future, it does give a bonus point, for a special but odd word.

DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the dart. That's a decent omen.

It is, apparently, an OAK DERBY drab yoke, from the small red print.

DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the tsar star. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-char-arch-nudges-tar

The tars remain heterogeneous. And very sticky. And the same size.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-arts
>arts
Being an arts tsar won't help. You need a word that shows anger.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-tard
>tard
Whether you are cursing the person who put the dart there, or yourself for not being able to get the dart, a slur like that isn't the way to go. In fact, it isn't the way to go in real life, either! A Roiling Original doesn't want to be THAT sort of juvenile.
You see red at your slight indiscretion
>tard
Instead of using that word again, you think back to why you saw red after thinking it, beyond being embarrassed. You need a four-letter word, but T, A, R and D are in the wrong place. You take the time to write out all 24 possibilities, noting only nine remaining ones are valid. And that's before you use the settler. You also remember some mumbo-jumbo about the inclusion-exclusion principle, and how a random configuration of N items in a set has about a 1-1/e chance of having none right.
You don't feel dumb after doing this, so there's really no need to use that word again. Not that there ever was.
>tard
You are just trolling now. No further clues for you.
