You try going north and looking for that poison stripe--but it's invisible and makes you wind up taking turns unconsciously. You arrive back at... the Same Mesa (thank you, I'm here all game,) from the south, after several minutes.

#testcase-outside-same-mesa
>out

Any direction from the Same Mesa seems as bad or good as any other. Perhaps there will be better clues what to do if you look around.

#testcase-exits-same-mesa
>exits
There are plenty of ways to go, but they don't seem to lead anywhere. There are three places to enter, though they do seem to shift.

Only, uh, unholy. You can curse anywhere else except here without repercussion.
#verbcase swear-routes-if-location-of-player-is-cleric-circle-if-curse-warned-is-false

A voice booms SACRILEGE? RAGE! SLICE! You feel horrible pain, and the last thing you hear is CRUDE? CURED!

Nowhere to go but out. Yup, not only does this restaurant lack ambiance, but it also lacks washrooms.

You can go back out.

#verbcase smell-routes-if-noun-is-pipe-soot

The lingering pipe smoke that made the soot is actually agreeable. The ashtray itself doesn't smell especially strong, so the pipe soot probably won't burn your hands if you can take it.

Those tirades from Ian Gast.

#ttc-table-of-routes-attacks-gast

You don't have a weapon big enough to take Ian Gast. One won't appear in your super purse. Anyway, he's not evil, just whiny.

Through the WOE BOW BELL's resonance, you think you could hear something if you listen carefully.

There's something new to observe here since you helped Brother Horbert. Maybe it will lead where you need to go.

Far into a rift? No. You can't see far enough to rely on directions, here. You'd likely wind up in Smasher Marshes or Shamers' Marshes, far from No-Lag Logan.

#verbcase smell-routes-if-noun-is-data-dim-mists

Ugh! The mists smell, as kids in Yorpwald say for slang purposes, staim'd. You see red at how useless and impractical such ridiculous slang is. Which, of course, makes it actually useful here.
