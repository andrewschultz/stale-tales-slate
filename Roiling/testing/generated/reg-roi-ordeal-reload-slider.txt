You begin a deep think, all about Elvira's rise to prominence and how she assured everyone that she could do wordplay if she were bored, and she was sure it was the best you could do, but really, there was no CREATIVITY at the heart of it, just calculation--and that tagged gadget to give clues was a bit TOO convenient. It passes the time, feeling upset.

Your settler throws out a bunch of beeps:  HIGH LOW LOW HIGH LOW HIGH LOW LOW.
Ugh. Those high notes gave you a migraine mini-rage. You switch off the slider.
You figure you can take that noise nine more times.
Since the diorama has instructions on what changes to what, and it is only a teaching instrument, you probably don't want to use up any more slider charges on any part of it.
>slon
>slaeepdt
You already got some data from the slider on the diorama. You may want to save it for other things down the road.
