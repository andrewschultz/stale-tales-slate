#pre-side-art-astride rule

You get astride the anti-sag sit-a-nag for a while, but it's pointless with nobody around. Maybe later.

You can sit ASTRIDE the anti-sag sit-a-nag once you have a reason to.

#pre-sitanag-against rule
>against
!by one point
You hear loud footsteps and hide under the anti-sag sit-a-nag in fear. A giant walks by but can't see anyone and runs off, complaining how there's nobody to complain to. Maybe if you had a reason to talk to the giant, or a purpose here, you might listen a bit better. Maybe if you could find a way to visit the Cleric Circle and find inner peace.
You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.

You can lean AGAINST the anti-sag sit-a-nag once you feel less fear and more purpose.

Mum Ray's Summary!

#ttc-table-of-mum-ray-summary-pages-1
>x summary
The story starts with Rev. Ali being violently opposed to Elvira. He dropped by the Same Mesa, and many people followed him. He was constantly yelling how she was too exciting, and the way to fight back was not to get swept up in her newness and be happy enough, you guess.

#ttc-table-of-mum-ray-summary-pages-2
>x summary
People listened to Rev. Ali, and his austerity helped prevent hearing about Elvira's latest charm offensive. But he got more and more severe, restricting where people could go, and even directions how to get there. If people knew where they wanted to go, and it was really important, they'd get there.

#ttc-table-of-mum-ray-summary-pages-3
>x summary
Then Elvira dropped by. Rev. Ali took the time to admit he was wrong! In doing so, he informed the residents of the Same Mesa that they would do well to follow his lead. Terrified, they accepted. Elvira's excitement had matured, and he didn't realize how good she was at pointing out people's faults. It would help to improve them.

#ttc-table-of-mum-ray-summary-pages-4
>x summary
Rev. Ali left, but with one final "character-building" challenge. The roads out of the Same Mesa would lead nowhere until someone found a new clever way out beyond them. And if nobody found the way out--well, there were some wise guys who were all about thinking for yourself. Maybe they were not as good at it as they claimed to be.

#ttc-table-of-mum-ray-summary-pages-5
>x summary
It was rumored Rev. Ali moved on to a new community to "help." His legacy remains, though. People are not willing even to visit Pat's and Oscar's. Why should they? The Same Mesa is a mix of countermanding and warnings about what you can't do, and how you can't even get the basics right, like cardinal directions. Someone needs to break through, somehow.
