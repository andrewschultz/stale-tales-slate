in Manor! You've found all the secrets here. You can just exit the gallery now, but it'd be a good idea to examine the settler, first.

You figured how to secure the ISBN bins. Nothing more to do.

"I offer you much luck and respect in your journey. I am impressed you want to get on with things and not worry about silly trivia and points like, um, me," the Respect Specter calls, with a hint of sadness.
"Oh. One more thing. Instead of the scepter you could've had, have Inducted Deductin'. It's got examples of how to use the settler. Just in case you need to brush up. It might spoil too much. So you can DROP it. But if you want it, here it is."

Your settler registers ?R?????
"Six ambiguous readings may seem like a lot, but you can maybe stop to think if any HAVE to be vowels or consonants. You can SCAN again if you want more hints."

"Well done." A scepter appears in the Respect Specter's hands before disappearing with a pop. "Oops, forgot to warn you, it wasn't real. But it wouldn't have been useful. Besides, the real treasure is the puzzles you solved along the way. While you didn't get the definitive hints from non-cheat scanning, I can suspect you see how it could work, combining both ways to scan."

"With cheat off, you'll know what's a vowel and what's a consonant for sure. This may help nail down ambiguous readings from cheat mode."

"In this case, the two vowels must be in slots 3, 5 and 6, so you can just try putting the only possible consonant in 3, then in 5, then in 6."

"I can't tell you the full solution, but you may also note that slot 1 and 7 both possibly being R can cut down the possibilities, too. You may need guesswork at the end if you can't see the word, but there are less possibilities than you think. In this case, you may stumble across the answer, so I can't say anything specific."

"This example was sort of formulated. It may be easy to guess. You may also be able to assume you can't have three or four consonants in a row, which can help. But I'm here just to show all the future possibilities."
