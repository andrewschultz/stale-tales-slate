#renudge for picaros
>picarso
There's only one picaro left, and his name is Rodney.
#scannotes for yo rend or deny rodney
>scan rodney
--hmm. Some of the spaces are blinking as if the settler couldn't tell what letters should be used. Maybe there are two ways to wangle things, or maybe the ambiguity is an extra clue. You could try re-scanning in non-cheat mode, or you can also HINT QUESTION MARK for a fuller explanation.
Perhaps Rodney's over-florid title will wind up being a weakness.

The voice you heard no longer echoes. You'll find a way north to the Wildest Wilteds.
#mistake test for posited
>posited
You formulate a proof that the place you are in does actually exist.
#mistake test for cleats
>cleats
The castle is run-down and unromantic enough. Changing it to cleats would be even worse.
#mistake test for a place
>a place
It already is a place. It needs to be more than that, to wipe off the stigma of being the curst palace.
#mistake test for crust
>crust
It probably needs less crust, not more. The whole curst palace.
#spechelp for curst palace
>curst palaec
The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: one word will work here, to make things as they should be. The final word is eleven letters long, but everything else is shorter--one necessary word has nine, as does another optional one, and a few have eight.
!Hmm...that's good practice, and a good guess, but even if it were right, you don't know if you could change the curst palace from here.
>curst palaec
Hmm...that's good practice, and a good guess, but even if it were right, you don't know if you could change the curst palace from here.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the Curst Palace. That's a decent omen.
#nudge for deposit
>deposti
It's not this location you need to change, but Castle Apcur, the Curst Palace across Leak Lake.
#nudge for fire
>fier
The fire-torn frontier has been changed enough. Maybe if you change the curst palace, it and other parts of the Wildest Wilteds will come back to life.
#nudge for torn
>tonr
The fire-torn frontier has been changed enough. Maybe if you change the curst palace, it and other parts of the Wildest Wilteds will come back to life.
#nudge for frontier

#nudge for pot
>tpo
The best--well, the only--way to change the top opt pot is to put something in it, but you haven't seen anything suitable yet.
#nudge for adder
>addre
You need to take care of all the adders.
#nudge for renato
>renaot
You don't have time to think about, or change, Renato. You haven't yet found anyone who might want the top opt pot, anyway.
#nudge for curst
>curts
It's not just that it's curst, it's a CURST PALACE.
#nudge for palace
>palaec
It's not just that it's a palace, it's a CURST PALACE.
#nudge for castle
>castel
Not just any castle. Castle Apcur.
#nudge for apcur
>apcru
Not, like, swamp Apcur or hut Apcur. Castle Apcur.
#nudge for start
>statr
The pastry is for eating, not for changing.
#nudge for tart
>tatr
Neither the singular nor the plural version of a pastry can change it. They're for helping you with other things, anyway.
#nudge for pastry
>pastyr
You need to be specific about which pastry--or you would, if any could be changed. All you can do with a pastry is eat it, once it's warmed.
#nudge for lake
>laek
You can't see Leak Lake from here, and you couldn't do anything with it, anyway.
#nudge for toaster
>toastre
It's a pretty sturdy toaster, a useful appliance as-is. Nothing you do or think seems to change it.
#nudge for blub
>blbu
Your anagramming prowess alone cannot change the blub bulb. Maybe somewhere along your journey, it can change into something new.
#nudge for wildest
>wildets
The Wildest Wilteds can't be changed on their own. They must be trekked through.
#nudge for wilted
>wiltde
The Wildest Wilteds can't be changed on their own. They must be trekked through.
#nudge for htu
>htu
The Shout-So Hut is built to resist words. You aren't getting through, or past, it, and you don't want to go back, anyway.
#nudge for south

The Shout-So Hut is built to resist words. You aren't getting through, or past, it, and you don't want to go back, anyway.

#spechelp for dreads adders
>saddre
The adders look downcast for a minute before resuming a threatening pose.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the dreads adders. That's a decent omen.
#scannotes for dreads adders
>scan dreads adders
Your settler registers RY?RYR.
Well, that's a bit ambiguous to start. Still, if you got by the prosaic picaros who had only one name, the dreads adders give a double clue.
#mistake test for dopiest

You sense that the dreads adders are one of the easier things to deal with, here, but you don't want to overstate it.

DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the Try Us Yurts. That's a decent omen.
#scannotes for bluster butlers
>scan bluster butlers
Hmm, no vowels nailed down in cheat mode. Maybe if you do a big of legwork to figure where they should be, some extra stuff will fall out.
#scannotes for snider diners
>scan snider diners
The snider diners sniff at the beeping from the settler. They notice you look confused at the question marks--well, momentarily. "What's this? Such distracting noise!" They go on to mention, drily, that a sophisticated palette will serve you better than knowing how gadgets work.
#scannotes for try us yurts
>scan try us yurts
Well, the orange kind of gives things away. And even with brute force, you can probably guess where the vowel is.
#scannotes for denier nereid

You can almost hear the denier nereid kibitzing that you didn't need to use the settler. There can't be many possibilities, with the two ambiguous readings.
