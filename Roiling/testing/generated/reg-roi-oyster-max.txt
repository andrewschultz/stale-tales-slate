#pre-trolls-stroll rule
>stroll
The LOLstr trolls seem concerned you haven't had any fun at all. You try to argue with them, but it's hopeless. They claim, bored, they're just the messenger as they escort you back inside. The galoots gloat so. Perhaps if you were more obnoxious, they'd be less inclined to keep you in.

>stroll
The LOLstr trolls seem concerned you have been kind of obnoxious, and what better way to make up for that than to order a little something, to get on management's good side, now. They act sore to scare, sure you stole a coaster. Perhaps if you were more obnoxious, they'd be less inclined to keep you in.

>spit
"Job perks: bop jerks," say the LOLstr trolls. The pesty types have formed a half-circle around you now.
by one point
>stroll
The LOLstr trolls make you feel like you're the jerk here and maybe you can spend some money to make up for the nuisance you caused. Perhaps if you were more obnoxious, they'd be less inclined to keep you in.
Maybe one more disruption, and you won't be worth bothering with.
!by one point
>remap
The LOLstr trolls and pesty types have almost completely surrounded you, but they are so shocked, even waiting for an explanation, they won't jump at you yet. Best play it cool and find a way out--now's a good time to STROLL.

#pre-tutor-trout rule
>tutor
You probably can't help the trout until they're off his case, but they wouldn't be on his case if he had tutoring in fighting earlier. Catch-22. At least, here. Also, the poor trout's probably getting beaten up for learning in the first place.
