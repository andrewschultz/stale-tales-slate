If the Horned Hedron could be undermined or infiltrated, perhaps things would get back to normal. And perhaps the haunter could be used against them. It hates them.

#ttc-table-of-notepad-entries-the-haunter
>pad haunter
The haunter is beneath Anger Range, but it is only part of what is making everyone angry. It is angry about a jewel it had stolen from it.

The LOLstr trolls seem concerned you haven't had any fun at all. You try to argue with them, but it's hopeless. They claim, bored, they're just the messenger as they escort you back inside. The galoots gloat so. Perhaps if you were more obnoxious, they'd be less inclined to keep you in.
