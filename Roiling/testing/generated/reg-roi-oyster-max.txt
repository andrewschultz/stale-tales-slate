As the yapper runs away, you look around a bit more. Hey! There's a templar ramplet in back, too! It might lead to a fun side adventure. You never know.

Nothing (significant) like that is in the immediate vicinity or region.

You'd think your lance would make you worthy of climbing the templar ramplet, but not in its current form. It's too dirty.

You do not have anything denoting you as worthy to trample the templar ramplet. If you want, you can look around, but it is optional.

/^Strip of Profits

#testcase-postrule-table-of-oyster-anagrams-post-dialer-redial-rule
Luckily, you find an evac-cave that lets you out safely. You decide to beat feet to the Anger Range.
Casper Spacer himself shakes your hand. "No hunter! On the run! None hurt!" He had gotten enough gritty writing from when the Horned Hedron still exerted its hold, but after a brief interview with you, now he has a story about--well, someone like you, with fewer faults, but more a tragic hero. He calls for his adventurer friend Red Gil. "Get this hero a glider girdle!" You learn it easily. Casper is even more impressed. You fly back to the Strip of Profits.
