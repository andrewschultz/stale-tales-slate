You look just fine.

There's no score in the Demo Dome. You just need to look around. Well, if you'd like a rank ... eh, you've done so much, I'll let you choose between Elites' Listee, Greaten-Grantee, Derivin' Diviner or Sharper Phraser. Or have them all. You've earned it!

Looking through Tester Street, you see how people helped the Stale Tales Slate become what it was. The "couldn't have done it without them" cliche is true in many ways. Of course, you can type CREDITS for individual names. Here is more general stuff with my reactions to testing.

It's called Venal Ol' Novella, by Evan Oll. That's probably a pseudonym. It's got a hundred pages, which you can examine by READ (number)--the lowest page you haven't read that looks comprehensible is 1. You can also speed-read with RR.
