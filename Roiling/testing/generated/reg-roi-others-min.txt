The Clangier Clearing to the east is full of the sounds of sale and commerce. You don't have currency or anything resembling it. Maybe you will get some from Curtis, if you do enough.

As you perform the toll-toss, you think you hear tots' LOLs. The box opens up, dissolving to reveal a popstar's passport.

>eat arugula
Not very tasty, but your vision seems clearer. "La! A guru!" you think to yourself. You can now GURU what you are curious about.

One look at Dr. Severe, and you realize Dr. Severe can just be REVERSED. The aftertaste of arugula finally dissipates.

# let's check "here/valence enclave" conditional text in the score
You have 25 of 46 total points for the post-Elvira Others region, and you should be able to go north from here to the Valence Enclave to win. You can't get the maximum score, since you used the arugula and missed a chance for something obscure with the sonic icons.
