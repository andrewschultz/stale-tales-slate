#mistake test for follow [text]
>follow zozimus
A Roiling Original doesn't allow the FOLLOW verb--you should ENTER a road or something if you need to.
#mistake test for psat
>psat
You have enough word juggling now. You don't need a standardized test, too.
#mistake test for beneath
>beneath
Nice try, but wrong preposition for the situation.
#mistake test for below
>below
Nice try, but wrong preposition for the situation.
#mistake test for spat
>spat
Picking a fight--or spitting--is uncouth.
#mistake test for staider
>staider
Nothing has gotten too riotous yet.
#mistake test for taps
>taps
You have no bugle. Well, not in A Roiling Original.
#mistake test for satired
>satired
You find nothing to satirize.
#mistake test for ptas
>ptas
Concerned parents won't be able to help you here.
#mistake test for tardies
>tardies
Actually, you have all the time in the world, and you don't need to delay anyone.
#mistake test for under
>under
There's nobody to hide from, though you could fit under the anti-sag sit-a-nag later.
#mistake test for among
>among
Maybe if there were mango trees around.
#mistake test for preposition/prepositions
>preposition
Yes, prepositions are the way, but you need to find which work, where. There are only so many, you think. You hope.
>prepositions

#mistake test for ouster-in-routes
>ouster
You're the ouster here, trying to get by the routes.
#mistake test for ames
>ames
Ames, Iowa is less nowhere than here for sure, regardless what some wiseguys from rival Big Twelve schools might say. But you can't just up and leave.
#mistake test for seam
>seam
You can't find any crack in the Same Mesa that you could follow.

#mistake test for aint
>aint
You don't need to make the anti-sag sit-a-nag any sturdier. And calling it ain't-sag would be false advertising.

#mistake test for aint gas/gas
>aint gas
The anti-sag sit-a-nag is plenty solid and will stay that way, independent of your efforts.
>gas
The anti-sag sit-a-nag is plenty solid and will stay that way, independent of your efforts.

The poison stripe is too incorporeal to do bend to your will.
#nudge for poisonstripe

Nothing happens. You twiddle both words for a moment, then realize it's probably them, combined
#nudge for sin
>ins
Nothing happens. You twiddle both words for a moment, then realize it's probably them, combined
#nudge for lairage
>lairaeg
Lairage regalia is already tailored to the resident's style. So it's not yours to change, but maybe noting what's on it will help you get in.
#nudge for pat
>tpa
That's not how to get into Pat'S, you reflect.
#nudge for orcas
>acros
Hm, it's Oscar'S.
>ascors
You twist and tilt your head but can't figure out how to interpret the regalia. But you must be close.
#nudge for ings

It's what's on the board you need to fix.
#nudge for board
>bodar
It's what's on the board you need to fix.
#nudge for adsorbing
>signboadr
It's what's on the board you need to fix.
#nudge for worst
>strow
If you change the ad from the worst, maybe you won't make it better. Maybe you'll make something else even worse. So, focus on the whole.
#nudge for scripture

It's more likely that scripture can change you, or help you see something a bit simpler to say

#nudge for mesa

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#nudge for rouet
>utreo
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for storeu
>utreos
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for satin
>atsin
The church's name is not as important as its mission.
#ttc-table-of-routes-scannotes-anti-sag-sit-a-nag
>scan anti sag sit a nag
Hmm! Maybe the weird name for the (not) bench can help you sort things out.
#ttc-table-of-routes-spechelp-anti-sag-sit-a-nag
>agastni
You hang around the anti-sag sit-a-nag, hoping for something to happen, but nothing happens. Though it seems like it should.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the anti-sag sit-a-nag. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-routes-spechelp-side-art
>astried
There's something in the side art, but you're not sure if you need to figure it out just right now.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the side art. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-routes-scannotes-lairage-regalia
>scan lairage regalia
OSCAR'S SOS ARC doesn't leave many possibilities. And only one ambiguous reading means you might be able to use standard logic.
#ttc-table-of-routes-scannotes-adsorbing-signboard
>scan adsorbing signboard
While signboard is nine letters, the text on it suggests a four-letter solution. If only you could figure where the vowel was, it'd be a slam-dunk.

#ttc-table-of-routes-spechelp-worst-ad
>towarsd
The ad seems slightly nearer, for a moment.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the worst ad. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-routes-readables-worst-ad
>read worst ad
"WARTS DO SOW, DRAT" is written below RADWOST but not in red. Hmm.
#ttc-table-of-routes-scannotes-worst-ad
>scan worst ad
Hm! The worst ad seems like it should be simple, but maybe you need to READ the whole ad to see where the weird reading is coming from.

#ttc-table-of-routes-spechelp-scripture-picturers
>insied
You feel you're not quite ready to enter the Cleric Circle, thinking like that. Well, not precisely like that. Your thoughts are close, but jumbled.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the scripture picturers. That's a decent omen.
#mistake test for indies
>indies
You don't need to worry about art, here.

Pat's is a local small business, not nameless, faceless real estate.

It's the whole side art you need to deal with.

#pre-side-art-astride rule
>astride
You get astride the anti-sag sit-a-nag for a while, but it's pointless with nobody around. Maybe later.
!by one point
#preefcheck side art
>pf
You can sit ASTRIDE the anti-sag sit-a-nag once you have a reason to.
#pre-sitanag-against rule
>against
!by one point
You hear loud footsteps and hide under the anti-sag sit-a-nag in fear. A giant walks by but can't see anyone and runs off, complaining how there's nobody to complain to. Maybe if you had a reason to talk to the giant, or a purpose here, you might listen a bit better. Maybe if you could find a way to visit the Cleric Circle and find inner peace.
You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.
#preefcheck sit a nag
>pf
You can lean AGAINST the anti-sag sit-a-nag once you feel less fear and more purpose.
