#testcase-mistake-roiling-follow-text

A Roiling Original doesn't allow the FOLLOW verb--you should ENTER a road or something if you need to.

You hang around the anti-sag sit-a-nag, hoping for something to happen, but nothing happens. Though it seems like it should.

OSCAR'S SOS ARC doesn't leave many possibilities. And only one ambiguous reading means you might be able to use standard logic.

#testcase-table-of-routes-scannotes-adsorbing-signboard

While signboard is nine letters, the text on it suggests a four-letter solution. If only you could figure where the vowel was, it'd be a slam-dunk.

"WARTS DO SOW, DRAT" is written below RADWOST but not in red. Hmm.

Hm! The worst ad seems like it should be simple, but maybe you need to READ the whole ad to see where the weird reading is coming from.
