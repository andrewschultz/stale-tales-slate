#mistake test for real hot
>real hot
But what emotion would provide heat?
#nudge for hurt
>hutr
No way you could change even one hurt thru on your own. You just need to get by.
#nudge for hurts
>hurst
No way you could change even one hurt thru on your own. You just need to get by.
#nudge for rathole
>reahlot
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#nudge for poverty
>pevtryo
There's no shortcut from poverty to the very top, but there's no definable state in between, due to the shrinking Yorpwald middle class. I'll spare the details.
#nudge for troev
>tevro
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for storev
>tevros
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#nudge for spoil
>spilo
You've got the right idea...sort of...but you're not worthy of big thoughts, yet.
#nudge for spoiloplis
>spilospilo
You've got the right idea...sort of...but you're not worthy of big thoughts, yet.
#nudge for potholes
>potholes
City Hall can't fix potholes, and neither can you. You feel a bit of lost hope as you try. You need to look out for, and look within, yourself, here.
#nudge for pothole
>pothole
City Hall can't fix potholes, and neither can you. You feel a bit of lost hope as you try. You need to look out for, and look within, yourself, here.
#nudge for pagepage
>pegagepa
It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.
#nudge for peg
>gep
You pause, then note the author's middle initial, which seems annoyingly important.
#nudge for egg
>geg
It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.
#nudge for pea
>epa
It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.

#spechelp for pa egg pea
>gaep
You gloss blankly over Pa, Egg, Pea, but you're not quite doing it right.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Pa, Egg, Pea. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-pa-egg-pea
>scan pa egg pea
Man! It's making the settler go crazy. Between the title and the author's name, there's a lot to consider. Maybe it will shake out.

DEBUG INFO: min-up codepath

#done rejects for pa egg pea

You probably did what you could. Or not-did.

#spechelp for tears taser
>staer
The tears taser makes an odd noise, as if it is recalibrating.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-tears-taser
>scan taser
The tears taser whirrs menacingly. Perhaps it recognizes you'll do what it takes to defeat it, or perhaps it looks down on someone who needs that much help. But either way, you've got some info on it now.
#nudge for tear
>trea
No, something as powerful as a tears taser will cause more than one tear to be shed.
#ttc-table-of-troves-readables-tears-taser

DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Eh, At Heat. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-eh-at-heat

#done rejects for heat
>haet
Don't need to overheat, or overhate.
#spechelp for race acre
>caer
For a second, things almost seem to matter. Then, back to the normal hopelessness. You must have been on to something, though.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Race Acre. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-race-acre
>scan race acre
Eh, two question marks in just four letters? You feel bummed you were given a second short puzzle in a row, then bummed you're (almost) not up to THAT.
#mistake test for a rec
>a rec
You've done nothing to deserve a rec yet. You need to think for yourself. Maybe you can become someone who give a rec, one day.

#not a mistake

#mistake test for pots
>pots
You can't see what you would do with a bunch of pots.

#nudge for bustle
>subelt
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#nudge for truffle
>tuffler
You can't change the truffle. It can help you change things, though. Or how you see things.
#nudge for boor

You can't change a whole suburb. Better to change yourself.
#nudge for grub
>gurb
You can't change a whole suburb. Better to change yourself.

#nudge for sob
>sbo
No, you'll want to zone out the whole verbose distraction.
#nudge for veer
>vere
No, you'll want to zone out the whole verbose distraction.

#spechelp for mussier misuser
>sumirse
The mussier misuser looks around a bit, worried someone might be out-thinking them.
#spechelp for sob ever verbose
>obserev
The sob ever verbose remains that way--mixing up subjects and making you consider things you hadn't before, in an effort to suck up attention from anyone around.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the sob ever verbose. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-sob-ever-verbose
>scan stop post
Nothing happens until you move the settler away from the post and towards the sob ever verbose.
The question marks ... hmm. Oh, you get it now.
#ttc-table-of-troves-readables-stop-post
>read stop post
POP'S TOTS is written in red on the stop post.
#redirects to sob ever verbose
>scan sob ever verbose
Your settler registers YRR?RR?.
!The question marks ... hmm. Oh, you get it now.
#mistake test for obverse
>obverse
You can't just make things obverse by wanting them to be. But if change comes within, perhaps things are closer to obverse than you think.

>observe
Your score has just gone up by one point

>score
Score in a scenario: 5 out of 30 total points in the current region, Troves. Lowest score to solve is 19. Maximum score available is 30.

#spechelp for stop post
>stpo
The stop post continues its silent defiance. You might need to look at it from a slightly different angle.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the stop post. That's a decent omen.
#nudge for observe
>obserev
You're already observing by reflex now. No need to tweak things.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-stop-post
>scan stop post
!Nothing happens until you move the settler away from the post and towards the sob ever verbose.
Well, that's a bit confusing. You'd think a four-letter word wouldn't have too many possibilities, but maybe STOP and POST are clashing.

#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-mussier-misuser
>scan misuser
Those question marks ... hmm. Oh, you get it now. Not super-sneaky, but the mussier misuser isn't, either, really.

>scan sty
!Hmm. That's a lot of uncertainty. Or, if you sit and think, maybe it isn't.

#spechelp for a sty tasty say

No. You pause. That can't be it. You need to do something, or nothing, differently.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from A Sty: Tasty, Say. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-troves-readables-a-sty-tasty-say

#mistake test for norse
>norse
The bee or arena's nationality is not relevant, and besides, it is a snore.
#mistake test for noser
>noser
A small orange blob with big eyes, short legs, and no arms falls off to the side, emitting garbled pseudo-profanity.
#mistake test for senor
>senor
The bee's gender is only relevant to the point of knowing it's a senora.

#nudge for stop
>stpo
The stop post is in the past. No need to p.s. tweaking it.
#spechelp for evil bee
>belieev
The bee's buzzing goes off-kilter for a bit. You gain a bit of faith you're on the right track.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the evil bee. That's a decent omen.
#spechelp for snore so arena
>reasno
The SNORE SO ARENA flashes weirdly.

#nudge for roadbed
>roadbde
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#nudge for live
>liev
The bee's description isn't important. It's how you see the bee that matters.
#nudge for bee
>bee
But it's not just any bee. It's an evil bee!
#nudge for snore
>snoer
Hmm. Nothing at all. It must be a snore.
#nudge for arena
>arena
Nothing happens. You may need to look at the full SNORE SO ARENA.

#renudge for bee

#mistake retest for norse

#renudge for snore
>snoer
You already managed to REASON with a snore. Nothing else to do.
#renudge for arena
>arena
You already managed to REASON your way around the SNORE SO ARENA.
#renudge for bee
>bee
But it's not just any bee. It's a live bee! Though, really, you've already given it the business.
#done rejects for evil bee
>belieev
The bee's already taken enough of your in-my-heartitude.
#done rejects for snore so arena

Drowning something without reason further in reason is unreasonable.
#spechelp for l clear cellar

#nudge for spider
>spidre
The diapers, the Ires Pad--the spider only fits in as *a* spider.
#mistake test for aspired
>aspired
Now is not the time to fret solely on past dreams. Fret on the hopeless present and future as well!
#mistake test for praised
>praised
You would like to be, but you can't just want others to. Change comes from within.

#spechelp for diapers
>despari
Staring again at the diapers, you are depressed you couldn't even get being depressed right.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the box of diapers. That's a decent omen.
#nudge for ires

It's an IRES PAD, not just ires.

A faint rye-be-beery odor.

#spechelp for large regal lager
>glaer
No...that is not quite the way to fight the temptation of the wicked brew.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the can of Large Regal Lager. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-large-regal-lager
>scan large regal lager
There's only one unstable color for three names in the Large Regal Lager, so that seems like a nice break.
#mistake test for alger
>alger
What would an Alger hero DO to such foul spirits as the lager, though?
#ttc-table-of-troves-readables-large-regal-lager
>read lager
The story on the lager is mostly in black, except where it mentions ERGAL AGLER, who brewed the first batch long ago, in red. I'll spare the details, because the story would kill almost as many brain cells as actually drinking the stuff.
>read lager
Your eyes gloss over all but the red name, ERGAL AGLER.

>glare

Score in a scenario: 13 out of 30 total points in the current region, Troves. Lowest score to solve is 23. Maximum score available is 30.

#nudge for glare

You stare into space some more but get distracted.

#mistake test for snog
>snog
You're too busy for...THAT. You focus on the singer. Probably someone you'd like to...hire to sing a song you wrote.
#nudge for diapers
>despari
You already twisted yourself into and out of knots from despair. Time to move on!

#nudge for song
>sogn
It's the full song name--I'd Cede.

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#mistake test for broomed
>broomed
You are not rich and consequential enough to snap your fingers and watch your own mess get cleaned up. Yet.
#mistake test for aled
>aled
Getting drunk will not solve your problems. Besides, you missed your "chance" with the lager in Drain Nadir. You see red at yourself for such thoughts.

#spechelp for lobster
>bolstre
That's not quite the way to deserve that lobster.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the BORTLES Lobster. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-bortles-lobster
>scan bortles lobster
Whoah! A lot of letters up in the air but a lot of matches, too. Maybe the matches will give you an idea about the uncertain letters.

#nudge for amrest

The ME ARTS nourished you spiritually. Time to move on, though you could poke at the lobster.
>undo

#mistake test for repeal/repeals
>repeal
That's the right sort of emotion, but REPEALS is the wrong verb tense, and REPEAL is only six letters. There is a better way to forsake the false pleasure of the pleaser leapers!
>repeals
That's the right sort of emotion, but REPEALS is the wrong verb tense, and REPEAL is only six letters. There is a better way to forsake the false pleasure of the pleaser leapers!

#nudge for leaper
>leapre
You'll probably want to deal with all the pleaser leapers at once.
#ttc-table-of-troves-readables-pleaser-leapers
>read leapers
SAP-LEER is the "ironic" name of the company that produced this monstrosity. They may have ironic distance from the time their customers waste, but their customers, alas, don't.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-pleaser-leapers
>scan pleaser leapers
You extract more joy out of knowing you can probably work out the ambiguous entries than from the leapers themselves.
#spechelp for pleaser leapers
>pleaser leapers
The leapers almost seem to dance around for a bit.

#spechelp for me arts

#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-me-arts
>scan me arts
Well! There are a lot of clues here, with Mr. East Stream Tamers and all, but this might make for some variety in the puzzle.

#spechelp for lead

You reflect that to LEAD, you must also put certain things in order. You know there are only so many ways.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from LEAD, All: a Deed. That's a decent omen.
#ttc-table-of-troves-scannotes-lead
>scan lead
Man! Only one stable red at the end. That whole title is certainly odd. Perhaps PART OF LEADING IS BEING ABLE TO THINK WHEN MACHINES CAN'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING. How very inspirational!
#ttc-table-of-troves-readables-lead
>read lead
You can't get settled. Everything seems too general or too specific, and as you read, you hear voices from the past: "What a yutz! He needs to learn to, like...!" They always acted as if it was so simple.
However, there must be some simple way to focus and move on.

#mistake test for once
>once
Yes! You only need a chance! Once! To get inside! But you're nowhere near enthused enough.
#nudge for cone
>coen
You think about the econ-cone being the recent center, but theorizing doesn't work. You need to look forward in other ways, to think of more concrete things, like that statue, or the praise floating in the air
#nudge for ave

No sense changing the Save Aves. You must change yourself.

You don't want to mess with the skyline. You want to get in the godlings' lodgings!
#nudge for godling

The godlings' lodgings are a testament to the immovable power of the rich. They can't be changed so easily. And if you did, Elvira's thugs would surely find and arrest you!
#nudge for godlings

The godlings' lodgings are a testament to the immovable power of the rich. They can't be changed so easily. And if you did, Elvira's thugs would surely find and arrest you!
#nudge for statue

The statue can and should be changed for aesthetic purposes, but Trevis Vister's lawyers would be on you for sure. Maybe there's a lesson from Trevis Vister himself in here.

#spechelp for praise spirea

That's not quite the way to look forward to praise. But it may be a start.
