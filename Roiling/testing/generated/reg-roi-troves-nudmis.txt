#ttc-table-of-troves-nudges-poverty
>pevtryo
There's no shortcut from poverty to the very top, but there's no definable state in between, due to the shrinking Yorpwald middle class. I'll spare the details.

It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.

#ttc-table-of-troves-nudges-peg

You pause, then note the author's middle initial, which seems annoyingly important.
