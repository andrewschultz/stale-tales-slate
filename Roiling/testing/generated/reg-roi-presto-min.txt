>pour cola in mug
You drain the ALocalCo cola bottle. It fills the mug, and you take a tiny sip. The liquid level refills after a minute. It tastes like car fuel, which makes you careful--and hopeful for a far clue. You feel more inspired and calmer than if you'd tried Loco-Alca or Loca-Alco, and your mind's clear enough, you finally see the right way to use a co-alloc. A recycling trap door makes a noise, and you pitch the empty cola bottle into it absent-mindedly.
The Be-Troo E-Robot, from under the labs slab, clicks reprovingly. Probably because it's a bot o' root beer.
