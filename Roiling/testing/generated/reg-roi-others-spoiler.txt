You have 41 of 42 total points for the post-Elvira Others region, and you should be able to go north from here to the Valence Enclave to win. There are no fruits left to find or give back to Curtis.
Since you've changed all the fruits without using the arugula to GURU, I think you deserve to know you that you'll get a bonus point for that once you enter the Valence Enclave north of here.
!You can't expect anything more from Curtis.
