No daredevil gunman appears to help you. This isn't that sort of game.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-boarder
>boarder
Rustic Citrus doesn't make for great living quarters.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-broader
>broader
Rustic Citrus is secluded enough.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-cruits
>cruits
Alas, no recruits named Ric or Stu arrive for you to delegate anything to.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-smile
>smile
You smile at the slime. It can't be that hard to figure what to do. You even see red a bit, frustrated you haven't figured things out yet.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-miles
>miles
You don't want miles and miles of slime.

#ttc-table-of-others-nudges-arugula
>arugual
The arugula is just for eating, so you can change something else that's been stumping you.

#ttc-table-of-rustic-citrus-nudges-greenish
>sheerign
The greenish sheering can't be changed. Killing all those trees and plants would be bad for the environment, anyway. Perhaps if you had a sense of direction, you could figure how to leave.

#ttc-table-of-others-nudges-storeh

The compass is accurate enough. Changing it might ruin things.

#+ttc-table-of-rustic-citrus-nudges-greenish

You don't need that, and neither does Curtis.

#ttc-table-of-others-scannotes-sated-stead
