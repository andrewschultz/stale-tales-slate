Almost, but with the stein, there.

It almost fits when you try to insert it. About five-sixths of the way. Perhaps you could find some other way to do things.

Misspellings don't work, here.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-pacers
>pacers
Casper's writing is multifaceted, but he wrote a story opposed to cars and car races and stuff.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-parsec
>parsec
Casper doesn't take too kindly to sci-fi terminology. He writes rough and tumble nature-y stuff.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-phos

The bar fails to change into an ethnic restaurant.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-spyte

The pesty types probably spell it that way, but I'm not letting YOU do so.
#ttc-table-of-posh-hops-shop-nudges-pti

You can't pick out which pit to do something to. Maybe there's an action to apply to all of them.

The pesty types resist change. Not that they wouldn't mind a bit of drinking tales for next time. Maybe you could provide that. Maybe the only way to change them is by changing society.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-readables-stein

The stein reads TIENS in red, trying to be foreign and exotic, maybe.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-readables-jukebox
>read jukebox
Complicated instructions for, of all things, how to turn off the tunes currently playing. Always tunes, in red, never songs. Do, undo.
>read jukebox
Complicated instructions for, of all things, how to turn off the tunes currently playing. Always tunes, in red, never songs. Reset, set.

Complicated instructions for, of all things, how to turn off the tunes currently playing. Always tunes, in red, never songs. Do, undo, set, reset? Hm.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-readables-tips-pits
>read tips pits
IT'S P is written in red on the bottom.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-capers-recaps
>scraep
You think of mocking Casper's writing style, but that's not quite it. Something more direct and physically insulting, maybe.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from Capers Recaps. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-gins-sign
>igns
Nobody pays attention to your performance as you disobey the sign. Or try to. I guess the sign doesn't strictly disallow THAT.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the gins sign. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-tips-pits
>spti
The tips pits rattle a bit as you try to do ... something ... to them.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the tips pits. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-tines
>inste
Hmm. There must be some way to destroy the stein, but that's not it.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the tines. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-tunes
>unste
The tunes grow slightly less annoying, for a moment.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the tunes. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-trolls
>strlol
The trolls laugh at you a bit, but nervously.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the LOLstr trolls. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-scannotes-gins-sign
>scan gins sign
Hmm. Whatever the variable colors are, you think you can do something with the fixed ones.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-scannotes-capers-recaps
>scan capers recaps
Your settler is not giving a full readout. Spacer's books are known for deceptive simplicity, for stringing together short words everyone knows confusingly. Still, those three reds at the start must be a clue.
Casper and Recaps may be linked. You could probably bulldoze through with the information from scanning both.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-scannotes-casper-spacer
>scan casper spacer
Your settler is not giving a full readout. Spacer's books are known for deceptive simplicity, for stringing together short words everyone knows confusingly. Still, those three reds at the start must be a clue.
!Casper and Recaps may be linked. You could probably bulldoze through with the information from scanning both.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-scannotes-perma-amper
>scan perma amper
It's a perma-amper, so that might account for the twitchy light.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-scannotes-lil-ps-pills
>scan li'l p's pills
The pills can't be that fidgety. The particular brand must be a clue, too.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-scannotes-lolstr-trolls
>scan lolstr trolls
Well, of course it's not perfectly straightforward with trolls. And yet, as with other trolls, there may be simple ways to reason around them and put them in the past.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-nudges-storey
>storye
Trying to change the current region you're in all at once would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.
#ttc-table-of-posh-hops-shop-nudges-posh
>pohs
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.
#ttc-table-of-posh-hops-shop-nudges-tine
>tien
Just one tine doesn't seem up to much.
#ttc-table-of-posh-hops-shop-nudges-troll
>troll
Dealing with just one troll would cause the rest to call you a bully and beat you up. Gotta take 'em all, somehow.
#ttc-table-of-posh-hops-shop-nudges-recap
>recpa
Casper glares at you, as if he knows you're thinking all his recaps are the same. No. You need to deal with them all.
#ttc-table-of-posh-hops-shop-nudges-tune
>tuen
Eh, you know how jukeboxes are. One tune quashed, another pops up. Get rid of 'em all.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-nudges-jar
>jra
You suspect it's what's in the jar that's important.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-nudges-spill
>splil
You seem to be fumbling what to do with the pills.
#ttc-table-of-posh-hops-shop-nudges-jukebox
>jukebxo
You can't work on the jukebox as a whole, but maybe you could meddle with its two main parts: the tunes and perma-amper
#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-perma-amper
>rempa
You can't change the bad music selection. But you can neutralize it--the jukebox has instructions.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the perma-amper. That's a decent omen.
#+ttc-table-of-posh-hops-shop-nudges-unset

#testcase-mistake-roiling-el-doodle

That would be more in place in a game with palindromes. Someone should write one! Whoops, they already did and called it Ailihphilia. Um, I mean, I already did. If you haven't played it, you totally should. After you're done here, of course.

#testcase-mistake-roiling-rosa

Alas, no Lady of the Lake appears to help you. Her name, if she exists, is probably too hard to guess for A Roiling Original.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-arrive
>arrive
Easier said than done. Perhaps a river craft could help you across. Like the raft. Or the boats.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-frat-raft
>ratf
The frat raft rocks slightly.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the frat raft. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-oars
>oasr
The oars splash around in the water, briefly rising out, as if they don't belong there.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the interlocking oars. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-spechelp-sabot-boats
>bosat
Perhaps if you were louder and more confident, the sabot boats would hear you.
DEBUG ONLY: You feel a slight psychic push-pull coming from the sabot boats. That's a decent omen.

#ttc-table-of-disease-seaside-nudges-seaside

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see.
#ttc-table-of-disease-seaside-nudges-streamlet
>streamlte
The streamlets change, and don't change, at the same time. But that's just because they're water, not because of you. You don't need to do anything
#ttc-table-of-disease-seaside-nudges-streamlets
>streamlest
The streamlets change, and don't change, at the same time. But that's just because they're water, not because of you. You don't need to do anything
#testcase-mistake-roiling-a-cone

That wouldn't make the canoe any more helpful. It wouldn't make it any less helpful, either. Maybe the frat raft or sabot boats are a better bet.
#ttc-table-of-disease-seaside-nudges-canoe
>caneo
The canoe sways alarmingly. Maybe it isn't the best vessel for crossing the river.
#testcase-mistake-roiling-ocean
>ocean
As you seek to change the canoe, you hear a rush of water, quickly examine the canoe, and realize that the red fish cutting the tree there is, in fact, a herring. The last thing you needed was more water! But it is too late to change the ocean back. You don't even see if Shoer Osher's statue was washed away as well.

#ttc-table-of-disease-seaside-nudges-oar
>ora
If you looked at just one oar, the raft would do no better than go in circles.
#ttc-table-of-disease-seaside-nudges-boat
>bota
No one boat seems better than the others. Maybe you should widen your focus to all the boats.
#ttc-table-of-disease-seaside-nudges-interlocking
>interlockign
Whoah, they're just oars. Think simpler. Much simpler.
#ttc-table-of-oyster-scannotes-frat-raft
>scan frat raft
You're pretty sure you can get this one quickly. I mean, you've been given one of the letters.

#ttc-table-of-oyster-scannotes-sabot-boats
>scan sabot boats
It can't be too hard to get the boats' attention. Something brute-force must work. Once you've figured this out, you may want to proclaim how great you are. That could help!
