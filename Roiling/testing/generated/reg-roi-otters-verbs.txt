Goodness! Yer All a Yell'r is a truly horrible song, but it captured a certain rubbish zeitgeist enough to get to #1 on the Yorpwaldian Top 40 charts for a while. You remember how everyone said it was the catchiest song ever, then they said it was old and played out.
Sadly, now, with songs like Yeah, Hey, A Yeeha, Yah, some people see it as a beloved classic that music these days can't compare to. Even more sadly, they have a point.
