That'll be tricky, moving through or between Thor and the New Beet without being sure of the ship controls.

First things first: you need to outlast that noise.

Thud, thud, thud. You might be able to do that properly later, but not now, with the noise distracting you from your new job listed on your vanity.

[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]
You don't have any apparatus to hook the screen up to. Yet. It'd get damaged on your further adventures, even in your super purse. Technology is like that. But you file the idea for later, in case you find some tech den.

Not yet.

You suspect someone is in the mist where the maze was. 'THERE!' you yell. But you doubt you fooled or intimidated them. You need backup.

Leo and Rand charge in. It's two-on-three, though, since you don't even have a weapon--and the enemies are bigger than you. You all walk back, slightly beaten up, muttering 'Ah, ow, whoa.' Leo and Rand shake off their bruises. Still, you note you started things right.

You make a note you can flip the disk back based on the lossless compression algorithm, etc., and how you don't need to know the deep math cold to be able to use it, or to remember the basics.

The trolls seem concerned you haven't had any fun at all. You try to argue with them, but it's hopeless. They claim, bored, they're just the messenger as they escort you back inside

>sing
>stroll
The trolls seem concerned you have been kind of obnoxious, and what better way to make up for that than to order a little something, to get on management's good side, now
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]

>scrape

The trolls make you feel like you're the jerk here and maybe you can spend some money to make up for the nuisance you caused

Like a butterfly's wings in China, your fart causes the raft to waver. Maybe if you got on the raft, something more would happen.

That's a good idea, but you're not sure HOW to react. You need a bit of data, first.

'Goodness me!' cries Aunt Tuna. 'I do not approve of warping the bubble wrap! You ought to be sent from THIS nest for that noise!'[paragraph break]Like all good bubble wrap, maybe it needs to be saved til you find the right person to annoy.

That would be fun but useless here. Perhaps you could annoy someone with it. Someone worth getting rid of.

Your word, stupendous as it is, has no effect. Yet. You may just need to go back outside.

>gonear trefoil
>droney
Rodney's voice would certainly seem droney by itself, but he segues into a marching song. I guess when you're a leader, you have that confidence. Maybe diminish his forces?
[You add the information to your pedanto-notepad under FLIPS.]
>yonder
Your attempt to bounce Rodney yonder is blocked by a few of his followers, who stumble a bit but stay upright as they combat the invisible force sucking him away. That looked like the right idea, but maybe get rid of a few of them, first?

You try to argue that you're that person who saved Yorpwald in the first place, but you have no compelling reason--or evidence, really, that you're, well, YOU. Le Mer is unmoved.

That seems like it should work, but you just can't summon the power. Someone here should be able to help you, you hope.

You'd look a little too suspicious mingling without anything of value to trade. Maybe when you have something, though.
