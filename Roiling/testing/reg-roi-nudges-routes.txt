You try going north and looking for that poison stripe--but it's invisible and makes you wind up taking turns unconsciously. You arrive back at... the same mesa (thank you, I'm here all game,) from the south, after several minutes.

>u
That won't work right now.

#nudge for orcas
>acros
Hm, it's Oscar'S.

>ascors
You twist and tilt your head but can't figure out how to interpret the regalia. But you must be close.

>ames
Ames, Iowa is less nowhere than here for sure, regardless what some wiseguys from rival Big Twelve schools might say. But you can't just up and leave.

#nudge for mesa
>esma
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

#nudge for storeu

#nudge for pat
>apt
That's not how to get into Pat'S, you reflect.

##nudge for reagent

The words themselves do nothing. You found the way in.

##nudge for sin
>ins
The words themselves do nothing. You found the way in.

>past

You hang around the bench, hoping for something to happen, but nothing happens. Though it seems like it should.

The bench is too sturdy. You can't do anything with it, but you may be able to do something with or around it.
