You've started to get some action in.

Olde Lode

>poss

>score
Score in a scenario: 1 out of 39 total points in the current region, Oyster. Lowest score to solve is 27. Maximum score available is 37.

>z

The pills form a large maze with no dead ends. The clam goes after the bouncing pills and eats some, zigzags crazily, and runs himself tired tracking new ones down. Then, suddenly, it looks as if it's seen a ghost. It shrivels to a point with a sad deflating noise, then vanishes with a pop!

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to CALM the clam.

>z

The urn, being possessed of greed, seems to suck in the pills, which cause it to shake. You run in a random direction as it explodes. Hm, run, urn. You could've figured that, but, well, time to move on.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to RUN from the urn.

Hero's Shore

>z

Before you can protest, you're aboard. You hear yelling as several of the fish realize the "coins" are pills. They don't like freeloaders...
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

Fighter Freight
You're near the edge of a fighter freight. You're half-paralyzed with fear. With or without that pale plea echoing from below.

Scary crays hover here, on the verge of attacking.

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to BOAST to get over the river.

>z

Some of the crays are dumb enough to think that the pills might be coins. In the ensuing hubbub of arguments between smart fish and dumb fish, you jump over the edge and swim to shore.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

Anger Range
This place manages to n-rage you, as well as the fish who live here. You see plains to the north, and you can go west or east, too. You think back to someone annoying named Regan.

Some carps and pikes re-nag and re-nag a poor little trout here. Another reason for anger!

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to LEAP after the pale plea.

>z

The carps and pikes, distracted by the pills that fall out and keep jumping, ignore the trout. "You stupid! Those pills are valuable. Out of our way, mouth-breather." The range anger wells up in you.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to SCRAP or SPIKE the carps/pikes.

>e
Lean Lane
The pills make a racket as they bounce around. A matronly tuna sticks her head out a window and yells IF YOU PLEASE. You notice your friend the trout behind her. He waves to you. The tuna invites you up.
Handsome Sand Home

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to SEEK the eeks.

>swipe wipes

You spill the pills. "That is some way to repay the nice meal I gave you! You will not get to see what is in that drawer and not just because you barely did anything for poor Tortu!" clucks Aunt Tuna. "I will thank you to leave immediately."

You do, but soon after, Tortu hands you a pack of bubble wrap and something from the tea tray, too--a paler pearl. "Man! That's the funniest mad my aunt has been in a while! I guess she is nice and all but sometimes I sort of want to rebel don't know how. Anyway, once you left, she kept muttering how she wanted to get rid of this bubble wrap to somebody. So I snuck it for you."

Anger Range

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to TUTOR the trout.

>n
Lapsin' Plains
The pills jump over to the debris and then off somewhere. You think they showed you where the throwing came from.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]
--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to TRACE the crate.

>z
The pills jump over to the debris and then swarm in the air like bees, causing your hidden tormentor to shriek and run away.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]
--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to REACT to the next crate.

>z
The pills fly to the skis with a bizarre smooching noise. The skis dissolve, perhaps out of inanimate shame.
--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to KISS the skis.

>z
The pills gravitate to the knob and turn it forcefully. It won't act up again.
Your last act seems to have broken the door's will to block you. It emits a rude odor, rued briefly, and it creaks open with a hinge-neigh and grumpy "Open door? Done poor." You're all "Postpone? Stop? Nope."
--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to BONK the knob.

>z
You spill out a pill, cautiously, but nothing happens. Maybe you're done here.

>in

You spill the pills and slip on them, because no bathmat is around. In the process, you smack your elbow against the tubs. Right on the funny bone. You find it so unfunny you beat the tubs into waste. Which might be hiding more than just that prod you found inside.
--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to BUST the tubs.

>z
You spill the pills, which bounce around at your legs until you're annoyed enough to start hitting at them with the prod. Foomp! A hidden switch triggers, and the prod transforms to a rigged digger.
--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to DROP the prod.

>shape

>out

"Man! That might just be the cure for my ears!" The sardine grabs the pills as the first one falls, and in a brief melee, your bubble wrap falls. He flees, and as you run after him, you step on the bubble wrap, causing it to tear and pop.

The wrap feels ruined, now, like you can't warp it, but you do notice a ruby inside. It seems valuable. So you take it.

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to WARP the wrap.

>z

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to SEARCH the arches.

>z
You absent-mindedly shake the pills out. Some bounce off the general gleaner, which swells oddly, and as you look for cracks or damage, you see a pattern within. A way through a maze.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to ENLARGE the gleaner.

>x gleaner

>n
>w

The pills swarm your ruby so you drop it. They sink into the dirt, the ruby close behind. The dirt fills, leaving a thin hint.
--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to BURY the ruby.

>e

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to UNEARTH the haunter.

>z
The haunter stays your hand. Perhaps it had a sad incident in its past which sent it to earth sooner--or made it lose its ruby. It nods at you in understanding.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]
--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to ASSUAGE the sausage.

Tenfold Teflon'd Den Loft

>z
The yapper begins bellyaching about picking up the pills. He complains about how it's HIS job to clean things up. He goes off to look for a wastebasket--but you think you see him popping a pill as he leaves.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to PREPAY the yapper.

>z
You spill the pills on the dialer, and they change DIALER to enough of the 720 possibilities that they settle on DERAIL.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to DERAIL with the dialer.

>z
You spill the pills and hook yourself on the dialer trying to catch them. You wind up REDIALing, and all sorts of hubbub ensues as Elvira's voice crackles, and she accuses the hedron, and the hedron accuses her.

--instead of using the pills, you could've tried to REDIAL the dialer.
