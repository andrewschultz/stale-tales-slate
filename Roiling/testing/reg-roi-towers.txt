The copse and the scope are both fine as-is, though maybe you can do something about the yurts.

>spce
The copse and the scope are both fine as-is, though maybe you can do something about the yurts.

>rutys
The yurts sway slightly. They may not be guarding much, but maybe you could do for them.

>ruty
There's more than one yurt there.

>rusty
The yurts grow tarnished and crumble. Behind them, you see and take some "nutrition" as cheap as the yurts that held it: Owers'-Bin Brownies! The snack of choice for people who prefer quantity over quality!

>spec
The copse and the scope are both fine as-is.

>patrys
You need to be specific about which pastry--or you would, if any could be changed. As is, you can just eat one at a time once it's warmed.

>owers
The pastry is for eating, not for changing. It might be more edible if you heated it up, though.
>bin
The pastry is for eating, not for changing. It might be more edible if you heated it up, though.
>brownies
The pastry is for eating, not for changing. It might be more edible if you heated it up, though.

Neither the singular nor the plural version of a pastry can change it. They're for helping you with other things, anyway.

>hukl
You make some helpless-sounding noises, trying to form a sensible word. The hulk looks slightly annoyed, but completely--and rightfully--unworried. As Daltho said, four letters would be too simple.
>musclyhukl
You wrack your brain but quickly get the sense you're over-thinking how to ju-jitsu the hulk's strength.

The cliff remains motionless. Perhaps it's useful, after all, to block off some ways to go. This area looks big enough.

Unblest Sunbelt

>nameless
The salesmen laugh at the sheer [i]lameness[r] of what you're saying, or trying to say, or whatever. Compared to you, their maleness, talk--and clothes--are clearly [i]dandier[r].[paragraph break]Or maybe they're just too unimaginative to be affected by any of your nonsense powers. Well, directly.
>salesmna
Picking off one salesman would just make the others work harder for their commission. And it's not doable, anyway. If you got rid of their product, they might stop pestering you.
>shirst
The shirts were built to resist the most direct of manipulations. Perhaps you can work on the salesmen themselves. Because the shirts do make them look dandier.

>deacno
[plutry of deacons]There's more than one deacon blocking you.
>deacosn
The deacons mumble to themselves, and you catch 'Lo! Is the...?' / 'Toils, eh.' and your calling upon supernatural powers that clearly don't exist. You feel devoid of can-does after your latest attempt, mumbling 'Eh, I lost.'[paragraph break]You get the sense the deacons have given you the run-around. They're not going to discuss their hostile ol['] heist around you[if deacons are ncscanned]--but maybe you can muddle through the odd readings from the settler[end if].

>galo
The gaol is too much. It's built to resist you, and unlike the curst palace far away, it was never built to be something nicer.
>loggalo
Nah, you're pretty sure you're overthinking things now. You [if duck is returned]opened[else]may want to open[end if] the prison.

[he-she-c]'s a doctor! Have some respect when you try to scramble [him-her] up.
>doctro
That is too formal. Plus, Dr. Yow worked hard for a Ph.D., and changing that would be kind of mean.
>woryd
Dr. Yow seems to ponder something for a second but then shakes [his-her] head[if doc-y has been rowdy and doc-y has been wordy]--[he-she]'s probably shown [his-her] full range of emotions[else if doc-y has not been rowdy and doc-y has not been wordy]--but [he-she] can't break out of [his-her] shell[else]--maybe there's one more way for [him-her] to be, to talk[end if].
