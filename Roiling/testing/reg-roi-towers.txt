You don't have time to think about, or change, Old Hat Daltho. You haven't yet found his friend he sent the gift to, anyway.

You can't do much with either part of Ray's name. Plus he has that keycar.

You can't do much with either part of Ray's name. Plus he has that keycar.

>creaky

>toastre
It's a pretty sturdy toaster, a useful appliance as-is. Nothing you do or think seems to change it.

>get tarts

>statr
The pastry is for eating, not for changing.

>tatr
Neither the singular nor the plural version of a pastry can change it. They're for helping you with other things, anyway.

Scope Copse

>spoce
The copse and the scope are both fine as-is, though maybe you can do something about the yurts.

>spce
The copse and the scope are both fine as-is, though maybe you can do something about the yurts.

>rutys
The yurts sway slightly. They may not be guarding much, but maybe you could do for them.

>ruty
There's more than one yurt there.

>rusty
The yurts grow tarnished and crumble. Behind them, you see and take some "nutrition" as cheap as the yurts that held it: Owers'-Bin Brownies! The snack of choice for people who prefer quantity over quality!

>spec
The copse and the scope are both fine as-is.

>patrys
You need to be specific about which pastry--or you would, if any could be changed. All you can do with a pastry is eat it, once it's warmed.

>owers
The pastry is for eating, not for changing. It might be more edible if you heated it up, though.

The pastry is for eating, not for changing. It might be more edible if you heated it up, though.

You think a bit, but Daltho's advice comes back--oddly rewired robot--only rewired is tough enough.

The diners smack their lips, and you think you hear the zhk of silverware.
Campiest Campsite
>campsiet
Gosh! The campsite's about as swell as can be, as is. No need to rearrange anything!

>leavse
Yes, it's fun to mess with leaves, but distracting.

>e
>hukl
You make some helpless-sounding noises, trying to form a sensible word. The hulk looks slightly annoyed, but completely--and rightfully--unworried. As Daltho said, four letters would be too simple.
>musclyhukl
You wrack your brain but quickly get the sense you're over-thinking how to ju-jitsu the hulk's strength.

There's more than one diner blocking you.

Baldest Blasted Saltbed

>baldets
It's not this location you need to change, but Castle Apcur, the Curst Palace across Leak Lake.

>clfif
The cliff remains motionless. Perhaps it's useful, after all, to block off some ways to go. This area looks big enough.

>piraet
Changing just one pirate would not, you sense, do much. It might even ostracize him among his peers. Perhaps there's a way to deal with the lot of them. By adding an s.

Savager Ravages
>ravagse
This is a weird place, being at the crossroads, but better to get rid of the weeds.

Gumming up one weed wouldn't get the others.

The saver is hopelessly no-frills. It'll never be anything better. But maybe you could revisit its brand name to make it look nicer. Not that looks matter.

>costuem
You fail to cut some from the costume. Maybe it's more what the costume advertises--REED'S ALE.

>resealed
You concentrate, and suddenly the man figures how to rezip himself. He runs off, maybe to bug other guardians about the smooth taste of Reed's Ale.

You concentrate, and suddenly the man figures how to unzip himself. He runs off, looking a little more dignified.

Unblest Sunbelt

>nameless
The salesmen laugh at the sheer lameness of what you're saying, or trying to say, or whatever. Compared to you, their maleness, talk--and clothes--are clearly dandier.
Or maybe they're just too unimaginative to be affected by any of your nonsense powers. Well, directly.
>salesmna
Picking off one salesman would just make the others work harder for their commission. And it's not doable, anyway. If you got rid of their product, they might stop pestering you.
>shirst
The shirts were built to resist the most direct of manipulations. Perhaps you can work on the salesmen themselves. Because the shirts do make them look dandier.
>casn
You think a bit. The salesmen don't emphasize one word over the other during their sales pitches, so the NERD and AID of Nerd-Aid seem equally ludicrous. I mean important.

Until you see the ego-drains themselves as organised, you probably won't see how to get past them.

>deacno
There's more than one deacon blocking you.

>deacosn
The deacons mumble to themselves, and you catch "Lo! Is the...?" / "Toils, eh." and your calling upon supernatural powers that clearly don't exist. You feel devoid of can-does after your latest attempt, mumbling "Eh, I lost."
You get the sense the deacons have given you the run-around. They're not going to discuss their hostile ol' heist around you.

>scan deacons

>deacons

The shrine is kind of sacred, and regardless of what you think of the deacons' religion, messing with it would be a mean move.

Obscurest Subsector

>fissuer
Bizarre animal noises continue to emanate from the fissure. It is beyond your control, and you wonder who or what could tinker with it

>obscurets
It's not this location you need to change, but Castle Apcur, the Curst Palace across Leak Lake.

>glo
The gaol is too sturdy to defeated by a three-word combination. Or a four-word one.
>galo
The gaol is too much. It's built to resist you, and unlike the curst palace far away, it was never built to be something nicer.
>loggalo
Nah, you're pretty sure you're overthinking things now. You may want to open the prison.
>jali
It's not just any jail--but prison ropins.

Ew. Rats. You do feel like a waster, doing something with the waters. Perhaps the northern--or eastern--shore can work better.
