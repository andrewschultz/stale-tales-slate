>rutys
The yurts sway slightly. They may not be guarding much, but maybe you could do for them.

>ruty
There's more than one yurt there.

>spec
The copse and the scope are both fine as-is.

>patrys
You need to be specific about which pastry--or you would, if any could be changed. As is, you can just eat one at a time once it's warmed.

The pastry is for eating, not for changing. It might be more edible if you heated it up, though.
