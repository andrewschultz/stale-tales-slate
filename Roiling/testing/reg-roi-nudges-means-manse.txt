** interpreter: /home/andrew/prt/glulxe -q

* weird stuff

#nudge for manse
>manes
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both

#done before you see the space capes
>spaec
Meta-commands don't have any easter eggs, sadly.

>purloin settler
>purloin purse
>purloin treatise

* cluing and such

#nudge for door
>droo
No. The door's all that protects you from the outside world.

#nudge for side
>sied
No. The door's all that protects you from the outside world.

#nudge for sidedoor
>sieddroo
No. The door's all that protects you from the outside world.

#nudge for rove
>ervo
That's not a way to sneak around and avoid any future knock at the door

#nudge for study
>udsty
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

>think
>x bookshelf

#rove over anagram while G knocks
#dupnudge for rove
>ervo
That's not a way to sneak around and avoid the knock at the door.

>open door
>1
>5

#nudge for dark
>dark
You punch your fist as you realize DARK has no anagrams...right into the palm

#nudge for darkness
>darksens
Oh no, not again. Concentrate on the palm

#nudge for palm
>palm
You think you feel the palm shake a bit, but nothing terribly magical happens.

>lamp

#nudge for bowling
>bowling
It's more that it's a giant pin and not, like, a safety pin
#nudge for bowlingpin
>bowlingpin
It's more that it's a giant pin and not, like, a safety pin

#nudge for niche
>echin
It's not any old niche. It's your niche. And by your niche, I mean you see it as "my niche."

#nudge for books
>bskoo
The books could use some changing. But you're better off making Yorpwald itself safe for art, good or bad, first.

#nudge for book
>bkoo
The books could use some changing. But you're better off making Yorpwald itself safe for art, good or bad, first.

#nudge for shelf
>shelf
The books could use some changing. But you're better off making Yorpwald itself safe for art, good or bad, first.

#nudge for bookshelf
>bkooshelf
The bookshelf is too massively immovable. If you could magick it, all those books would probably create an avalanche, anyway.

#nudge for beams
>beams
Not even one of the beams rattles. You count them up again--there are ten.

#nudge for ten
>ten
You change neither the number nor the makeup of the ten beams.

#nudge for pin
>npi
It's one big giant pin.

#nudge for giant
>ignat
It's one big giant pin.

>painting
>x bookshelf

>painting
>painting
goes better

#nudge for abstract
>abstratc
That is probably overthinking the painting's abstract-ness. It's really just good for examining.

>basement

#nudge for tenbeams
>bamesent
You probably just want to go DOWN to the basement

>d

>gonear study
#dupnudge for tenbeams
>bamesent
You probably just want to go DOWN to the gallery

>mete
>snab

You should never need to riff on part of a location name

>u
>d

>stair
>u

#nudge for table
>table
A bleat: "tableS!"

>stable
>in
#nudge for framing
>framign
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

>in
#nudge for peephole
>pepehole
You don't need to change it. It was tough enough to create.

#nudge for latch
>ltcha
Not one latch. All of them.

>letchas
You think you feel static through the latches. But they remain the same. Maybe there's some easy way to change them.

>satchel

#nudge for satchel
>letchas
You don't need to do anything more to the satchel--and if it became latches or something else, the settler would probably get messed up, too.

#nudge for ceiling
>ceiling
You wouldn't want to collapse the whole ceiling, but maybe the MY NICHE words could be changed.

>chimney
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

#dupnudge for ceiling
>cieling
You already built the chimney. If the ceiling caved, you'd be buried.

#nudge for chair
>chira
The chair is built too sturdily to be changed into anything else. You made sure of that when you bought it, for practical reasons. You can't make it more or less hi-arc, either. But it's still soft enough to be relaxing.

#nudge for rich
>chir
The chair may be an unnecessary luxury, but you shouldn't feel bad about that.

#nudge for nitro
>nitro
!Elvira's

#nudge for oped
>oped
You're not going to change Elvira's opinion. Better to change Yorpwald.

#nudge for opedoped
>opedoped
You're not going to change this--deed

>x dope

#dupnudge for nitro
>nitro
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

#nudge for questin
>questin
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

#nudge for moneyco
>moneyco
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

#nudge for shatter
>shatter
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

#nudge for billy
>billy
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

#nudge for itrash
>itrash
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

#nudge for herarts
>herarts
!You try and twist
>gs

#dupnudge for itrash
>itrash
!You try and twist

#dupnudge for herarts
>herarts
You try and twist
>gs

#nudge for subpoena
>beansoup
Subpoenas are subpoenas. The law is the law. You don't know any lawyers good enough to wiggle out with THEIR form of word-twisting.

#dupnudge for palm
>pmla
If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.

#nudge for gape
>gpea
You feel like you physically want to crumple up the page, but you just stare blankly at it.

>u

#nudge for highest
>hightes
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

#nudge for height
>highte
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

#nudge for closets
>clostes
The closets are there to warp space a bit. You don't need to mess with them.

#nudge for closet
>closte
The closets are there to warp space a bit. You don't need to mess with them.

>prma
The pram creaks back and forth slightly.

>d

#nudge for gallery
>galleyr
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

#nudge for all
>lal
You should never need to riff on part of a location name

#nudge for grey
>>grye
You should never need to riff on part of a location name

#nudge for notice
>noitce
You can flip everything on the diorama except the notice.

#nudge for diorama
>dioraam
Old Man Almond assured you you couldn't change it by accident when he gave it to you. The stuff hanging from it, though...

#nudge for reading
>erdaing
You don't have time for literary criticism.

>tenbeasm
You probably just want to go DOWN to the basement.

>chimnye
You probably just want to go UP the chimney.

>stable

#nudge for stable
>stabel
You probably just want to go IN to the stable.

#nudge for sad
>dsa
The ads have probably gone through enough word-twisting.

>u
>ramp
>d

#nudge for evac
>ceva
The evac-cave is your way out. It'd be a bad idea to change it.

>enter cave
You look at your settler and realize you haven't really EXAMINED it.
>x settler
>enter cave

#nudge for elmo
>olem
Changing Elmo won't work. It's his rifle.

>z
>z
>z
>z
>z

#nudge for high
>high
The high sign is a clue. Bad idea to change it.

#nudge for sign
>sign
The high sign is a clue. Bad idea to change it.

#nudge for highsign
>highsign
The high sign is a clue. Bad idea to change it.

#nudge for arifle
>arfile
Just the rifle, well, not THE rifle, or JUST, rifle, but RIFLE.

#nudge for hostage
>hetsago
It's not you that needs changing but the rifle.

#nudge for gun
>ugn
It's not a gun but a rifle. And a gnu would be a gnu-sance anyway.

#nudge for flier
>flier
>3
>y

#nudge for cavern
>ecvarn
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>elptas
The plates shine slightly and rattle.

>elptasr
The plaster crackles and shines slightly.

>elptas
The plates shine slightly and rattle.

>elptasr
The plaster crackles and shines slightly.

#nudge for terrain
>terrain
Hm...it probably isn't that easy. The plaster and

#nudge for tapler
>tapler
What you need is singular, but you sense it's all the plaster that matters.

#nudge for plate
>taple
You have no idea which plate to focus on, so maybe you should focus on the plates.

>staple
>stapler
As paper appears behind, a stapler falls out. You take it. The paperwall behind looks lined but seems solid enough.

>elptasr
The plaster was cracking anyway, before you made it a shiny stapler. You don't need to change it again.

>elptas
Those plates were a mess, and now they're a tidy staple. It's better that way.

>paperwall
The paperwall is unmoved. Maybe the stuff that came from it  could help you more, here.

>paper
The paperwall is unmoved. Maybe the stuff that came from it  could help you more, here.

>wall
The paperwall is unmoved. Maybe the stuff that came from it  could help you more, here.

####test the Gird Grid

>x 1
The Poison Stripe surrounding the Same Mesa has caused people there to lose all sense of direction, physically and mentally. If one person could escape, that would change. The Oopsin' Priest may be able to help you.

>x 2
Spoiloplis was founded on self-help books, pyramid schemes, and other shady industries. Mayor Irv Lea lauds it as a center of positive thought. And not the nerdy brainy thought that goes into anagrams. You probably can't meet him, but maybe you can upset the social order.

>x 3
There is rumor of a Hacks' Shack immune to Elvira's SHATTER-THREATS legislation behind a near-nonsensical maze that may have you saying or thinking impolite words. In that Hacks' Shack, you may feel a sense of normality that gets you back to how things were before Elvira.

>x 4
A seashore seahorse mentioned a seaside dis-ease you need freaky fakery to avoid. Something about a hideout, and a gang called DIE THOU. Vigorous action is necessary, and a lot of it.

>x 5
The Bland Sad Badlands are not to be traversed lightly. People protecting their territory just because. Bandits sacking taverns for no reason. Castle Apcur, the Curst Palace, lies there, at the other side of Leak Lake. Condemned to be torn down to make a new MoneyCo office. Tax-free and all. Oh, and luxury condos endorsed by Avrile, that lifestyle maven. But if you could restore the palace somehow...

>x 6
Little is known about the region beyond Store T except that an Or-Not-O-Tron dissuades people from paying it much attention. It must be important!
