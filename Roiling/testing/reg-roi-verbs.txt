>x ads
It's impossible to look away...advertising certainly has gotten more prominent since Elvira arrived. She's been so good at saying you need to advertise, and yet--she does not need to. Apparently she is quite a consultant for opposing ad firms.

The ads aren't sad because they're drab but rather because so many people fall for them. And they're not even magically possessed. This is the price of prosperity, and yet... One ad hawks Mac Bly's Cymbals.

>x ad
Another ad 

>x questin
It's headed Good deeds? Sodded ego! Elvira lays out how you saved Yorpwald and all. But everyday stuff? You couldn't repair a flat tyre with flattery, make custard out of car dust or spumoni from an ion sump. Or even a cellphone from cellophane.

You pause. That's so contrived. What kind of faker-freak would think that up?
