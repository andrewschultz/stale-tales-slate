>x book
It's your workbook. It holds bookwork. The original, from the first time you saved Yorpwald, is in some museum. But this is about the same. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, and you have clipped a pen over it, too.

>au 1

>about
A Roiling Original is the sequel to Shuffling Around and part 2 in my Stale Tales Slate. I doubt there'll be a third, since I've milked the concept dry.

>verb
--N, S, E and W are the basic directions.
--TALK to an NPC gives general information, while ASK X ABOUT gives detailed information.
--OPTIONS or OPTS or POST OPTS gives you a list of game options that can simplify play or add detail.
--PAD to see a list of topics. Then PAD VERBS, for example.
--VERBS shows this, OPTIONS shows options you can change, and informational meta-commands include ABOUT, CREDITS, TECH, SITES, and RELEASE.
--You can GO TO/GOTO  or GT a location or thing if it's a bit far away but in the region.
--You wrote notes about how you can RETRY thanks to Terry if you get stuck somewhere past a store.

>verbs
--N, S, E and W are the basic directions.

>credits
I must direct credit to my testers for finding bugs and making sure this game was not mega (redacted).Thanks to Heartless Zombie (David White) for his hash code and suggestions, which removed many technical barriers.

>tech
All three of these people's efforts are also present in the first game, Shuffling Around. So I am doubly thankful.

>sites
I'd be interested if someone from France can ref these sites to make a similar game, someone from Spain could take pains, or a German manager could do so too. It'd be interesting to see.

>release
Each version of A Roiling Original should contain a text file with detailed release notes, but here is a brief summary:

>scan pin
It's not an odd DOA doodad! You recall writing in your notepad about your tagged gadget from your first adventure and how it helped you determine what you needed to change an object to. But the settler has new colors. You'll need to find what they're for.

[NOTE: if your interpreter supports Glulx, see the top for a graphical representation of the colorings. You can also type SPACE ON or SON to space out the text if you are visually impaired, or NO SPACE or NOS to lump the text back. Also, LA repeats what you scanned last, if the window on top does not show it.]

>x ads
It's impossible to look away...advertising certainly has gotten more prominent since Elvira arrived. She's been so good at saying you need to advertise, and yet--she does not need to. Apparently she is quite a consultant for opposing ad firms.

The ads aren't sad because they're drab but rather because so many people fall for them. And they're not even magically possessed. This is the price of prosperity, and yet... One ad

>x ad
Another ad 

>purloin dope op-ed

>x questin
It's headed Good deeds? Sodded ego! Elvira lays out how you saved Yorpwald and all. But everyday stuff? You couldn't repair a flat tyre with flattery, make custard out of car dust or spumoni from an ion sump. Or even a cellphone from cellophane.

You pause. That's so contrived. What kind of faker-freak would think that up?

>x wallpaper
It's oddly lined, with one vertical stripe on the edge and a bunch of horizontal stripes. There's a small pair of holes in the upper left-hand corner. You imagine it's many layers of papers, so pulling them one by one wouldn't work.

[You record the information about long commands in your pedanto-notepad.]

[NOTE: it's much easier to SCAN objects instead.]

You switch the settler, then shake it. Your vision swirls for a minute, and only Store V, Store B, Store H, Store K, Store N, Store P, Store T, Store U, Store W, Store Y and the tropes poster(but a bit blurry) are visible. It's a bit of a headache to stare too long, so you switch it off.
Wow! That's handy! The switch shows you which items identifiably change definability!

Before you can do anything with or to Ian, he thrusts a sheet of heartfelt reflections on drug use at you. "It will help you in ways you don't know. And even I don't know." Do you take it?
"Good choice. Say, if they're good enough, do you think you could put in a word for me--to a lecturer like THAT?

"What? Those biceps are from pure hard work. And a proper diet. And the right vitamins." He nods and points to the lecturer.
>x drug guardian

>x max
He's wearing a very expensive suit and tie. You're not sure why they should be expensive, but you know they are. They're probably about as showy as drug dealers' $5,000 suits and $300 ties. You read MAX P LEE, EXAMPLE projected behind him, and he is sponsored by RutCorp, who help pull you out of ruts, apparently.

The roads in Store U. What's another word for that? They're numbered, too. (+) [Note: the plus sign means you can HINT again for something more spoilery. (-) means the end of a list of hints.]

>info store u
The settler's a big help here, as it knocks out the vowel. Then you can try where T should go. Or better yet, you can guess that whatever it is is plural, and that knocks things out logically. (+)
