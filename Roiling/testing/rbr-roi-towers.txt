#pre-rodney rule
>yonder
Your attempt to bounce Rodney yonder is blocked by a few of his followers, who stumble a bit but stay upright as they combat the invisible force sucking him away. That looked like the right idea, but maybe get rid of a few of them, first?

>droney
Rodney's voice would certainly seem droney by itself, but he segues into a marching song. I guess when you're a leader, you have that confidence. Maybe diminish his forces?

#spechelp for curst palace
>curst palaec
The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: one word will work here, to make things as they should be. The final word is eleven letters long, but everything else is shorter--one necessary word has nine, as does another optional one, and a few have eight.
!Hmm...that's good practice, and a good guess, but even if it were right, you don't know if you could change the curst palace from here.

Your settler registers RRYR?YRYRY?.
The final entry blinks alternately with the fifth--neither is purple at the same time. The settler usually isn't this slow, but maybe you can take advantage of it having so much data to process
