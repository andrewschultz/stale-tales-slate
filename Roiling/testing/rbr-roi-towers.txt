#pre-rodney rule

Your attempt to bounce Rodney yonder is blocked by a few of his followers, who stumble a bit but stay upright as they combat the invisible force sucking him away. That looked like the right idea, but maybe get rid of a few of them, first?

Rodney's voice would certainly seem droney by itself, but he segues into a marching song. I guess when you're a leader, you have that confidence. Maybe diminish his forces?

This game doesn't require you to mess with diagonal directions, so maybe you should consider the other shores.

Hm, looks like the red wire doesn't make you SEE red. You were never an electrical whiz, but maybe general logic will help rearrange the tangled connections.

#mistake test for repents

The serpent remains kinda chaotic evil looking, and not just because it can't understand English. You see red at using a verb and not an adjective.
#mistake test for respent

You're not sure if the serpent's ever been spent, so you can't quite make it re-spent. You feel you have to be close, though.

The ur-pine shrinks, slightly. I mean, it recedes, but it doesn't quite get smaller.
