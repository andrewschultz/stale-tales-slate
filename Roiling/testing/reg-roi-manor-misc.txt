* weird stuff

>aliver
You don't want to risk anything that would make Elvira more powerful.

>alvire
Changing Elvira is impossible, and you certainly don't want to summon her.

>yalpdrow
You can't just unjumble Yorpwald with just one word. You need to deal with individual things.

#done before you see the space capes
>spaec
Meta-commands don't have any easter eggs, sadly.

>purloin settler
>purloin purse
>purloin treatise

You won't gain anything trying to magic the settler, or parts of it, about. It's got all the technical tools you need, though.

>ronth
This game almost never requires you to mess with cardinal directions.

>suoth
This game almost never requires you to mess with cardinal directions.

>ewst
This game almost never requires you to mess with cardinal directions.

>esta
This game almost never requires you to mess with cardinal directions.

>donw
This game doesn't usually require you to mess with directions you can go.

>southwets
This game doesn't require you to mess with diagonal directions, so I hope that's a relief.

>northwets
This game doesn't require you to mess with diagonal directions, so I hope that's a relief.

>northeats
This game doesn't require you to mess with diagonal directions, so I hope that's a relief.

>southeats
This game doesn't require you to mess with diagonal directions, so I hope that's a relief.

>gagdet
That was soooo last game! Not that Shuffling Around was lame. I mean, I wrote it, and all. Just, I got even better at writing since then, and I wrote in newer awesomer adventures.

>xyyzz
A hollow voice booms, "Lo! Of..."

>pluhg
A hollow voice booms, "Lo! Of..."

>plovre
A hollow voice booms, "Lo! Of..."

>iths
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>kcuf
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>mand
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>lleh
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>parc
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>hcek
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>llaw
You don't need to, and can't, do anything drastic to the walls when inside. That'd be kind of dangerous, anyway.

>llaws
You don't need to, and can't, do anything drastic to the walls when inside. That'd be kind of dangerous, anyway.

>echat
Aw, man, a third option for the settler wouldn't be fair. Trust me, it's powerful enough as-is.

>ings
You don't need to mess around with the sign on the settler, or any sign, except maybe one place, which you'll know when you see it.

>idlers
You can just switch the slider if you want to manipulate it.

>pruse
The purse is just fine as it is.

>aspec
You don't want to mess with the space-capes. They work.

>treaties
The treatise was there as help to discover the satchel. It has only sentimental value, now.

>purloin gird grid
>drig
The grid already contains pretty much everything Elmo was able to find out.

>writign
Red writing is a just clue of what to change.

>redwritign
Red writing is a just clue of what to change.

>erd
Red writing is a just clue of what to change.

>ryter
!You don't have any special tricks with RETRYing. Just do so if you're in a store and stuck.

>warning
You can't change warnings. Warnings are there to protect you. Even offer hints if you read them.

>pedanto
You don't need to change the pedanto-notepad, except maybe by filling it up with ideas. But to do that, you need to take it, first. And you do.

>pedanto
!But to do that

>cusser
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>obther
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>astarbd
You're not fooling ME. Shame on you!

>abstract elmo to lalaland

>pesar
There's no in-between for the PARSE and SPARE commands for the settler.

>ervb
There's no secret verb or verbs to find trying that.

>ervbs
There's no secret verb or verbs to find trying that.

>knith
Whenever you just try to too hard to think, things always get jumbled.

>cores
There's no way to scramble your score. And scoring another point won't help you solve things, anyway.

>opss
You can't jumble the possible scores any other way.

>istlen
Trying to change how you listen gives no intels.

>abotu
The "about" section has no easter eggs.

>credti
The "credits" section has no easter eggs.

>credtis
The "credits" section has no easter eggs.

>histoyr
The "history" section has no easter eggs.

>semithong
Instead of messing with SOMETHING, maybe you can examine what the something is on.

>ts
>ryter
You don't have any special tricks with RETRYing. Just do so if you're in a store and stuck.

* cluing and such

>ervo
That's not a way to sneak around and avoid any future knock at the door

>udsty
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

>think
>x bookshelf

#rove over anagram while G knocks
>ervo
That's not a way to sneak around and avoid the knock at the door.

>open door
>1
>5

>dark
You punch your fist as you realize DARK has no anagrams...right into the palm
>darksens
Oh no, not again. Concentrate on the palm

>palm
You think you feel the palm shake a bit, but nothing terribly magical happens.

>lamp

>bowling
It's more that it's a giant pin and not, like, a safety pin
>bowlingpin
It's more that it's a giant pin and not, like, a safety pin

>echin
It's not any old niche. It's your niche. And by your niche, I mean you see it as "my niche."

>bskoo
The books could use some changing. But you're better off making Yorpwald itself safe for art, good or bad, first.

>bkoo
The books could use some changing. But you're better off making Yorpwald itself safe for art, good or bad, first.

>shelf
The books could use some changing. But you're better off making Yorpwald itself safe for art, good or bad, first.

>bkooshelf
The bookshelf is too massively immovable. If you could magick it, all those books would probably create an avalanche, anyway.

>beams
Not even one of the beams rattles. You count them up again--there are ten.
>ten
You change neither the number nor the makeup of the ten beams.

>morna
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both

>npi
It's one big giant pin.
>ignat
It's one big giant pin.

>painting
>x bookshelf

>painting
>painting
goes better

>abstratc
That is probably overthinking the painting's abstract-ness. It's really just good for examining.

>basement
>d

>bamesent
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game

>mete
>snab

You should never need to riff on part of a location name

>u
>d

>same
>bent

>stair
>u

>table
A bleat: "tableS!"

>belts
>bastle

>in
>pepehole
You don't need to change it. It was tough enough to create.

>ltcha
Not one latch. All of them.

>letchas
You think you feel static through the latches. But they remain the same. Maybe there's some easy way to change them.

>satchel

>letchas
You don't need to do anything more to the satchel--and if it became latches or something else, the settler would probably get messed up, too.

>ceiling
You wouldn't want to collapse the whole ceiling, but maybe the MY NICHE words could be changed.

>chimney
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

>cieling
You already built the chimney. If the ceiling caved, you'd be buried.

>chira
The chair is built too sturdily to be changed into anything else. You made sure of that when you bought it, for practical reasons. You can't make it more or less hi-arc, either. But it's still soft enough to be relaxing.

>chir
The chair may be an unnecessary luxury, but you shouldn't feel bad about that.

>nitro
!Elvira's

>oped
You're not going to change Elvira's opinion. Better to change Yorpwald.

>x dope

>nitro
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

>questin
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

>moneyco
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

>shatter
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

>billy
You try and twist Elvira's words or poke holes where they're wrong...and you can't. Sheesh.

>herarts
!You try and twist
>gs
>itrash
!You try and twist
>herarts
You try and twist
>gs

>beansoup
Subpoenas are subpoenas. The law is the law. You don't know any lawyers good enough to wiggle out with THEIR form of word-twisting.

>pmla
If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.

>gpea
You feel like you physically want to crumple up the page, but you just stare blankly at it.

>u

>hightes
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>highte
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>clostes
The closets are there to warp space a bit. You don't need to mess with them.

>closte
The closets are there to warp space a bit. You don't need to mess with them.

>prma
The pram creaks back and forth slightly.

>d

>noitce
You can flip everything on the diorama except the notice.

>dioraam
Old Man Almond assured you you couldn't change it by accident when he gave it to you. The stuff hanging from it, though...

>erdaing
You don't have time for literary criticism.

>tenbeasm
You probably just want to go DOWN to the basement.

>chimnye
You probably just want to go UP the chimney.

>stable
>stabel
You probably just want to go IN to the stable.

>dsa
The ads have probably gone through enough word-twisting.

>u
>ramp
>d

>ceva
The evac-cave is your way out. It'd be a bad idea to change it.

>enter cave
You look at your settler and realize you haven't really EXAMINED it.
>x settler
>enter cave

>olem
Changing Elmo won't work. It's his rifle.

>z
>z
>z

>high
The high sign is a clue. Bad idea to change it.

>sign
The high sign is a clue. Bad idea to change it.

>highsign
The high sign is a clue. Bad idea to change it.

>arfile
Just the rifle, well, not THE rifle, or JUST, rifle, but RIFLE.

>hetsago
It's not you that needs changing but the rifle.

>ugn
It's not a gun but a rifle. And a gnu would be a gnu-sance anyway.

>flier
>3
>y

>ecvarn
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>elptas
The plates shine slightly and rattle.

>elptasr
The plaster crackles and shines slightly.

>elptas
The plates shine slightly and rattle.

>elptasr
The plaster crackles and shines slightly.

>terrain
Hm...it probably isn't that easy. The plaster and 

>tapler
What you need is singular, but you sense it's all the plaster that matters.
>taple
You have no idea which plate to focus on, so maybe you should focus on the plates.

>staple
>stapler
As paper appears behind, a stapler falls out. You take it. The paperwall behind looks lined but seems solid enough.

>elptasr
The plaster was cracking anyway, before you made it a shiny stapler. You don't need to change it again.

>elptas
Those plates were a mess, and now they're a tidy staple. It's better that way.

>paperwall
The paperwall is unmoved. Maybe the stuff that came from it  could help you more, here.

>paper
The paperwall is unmoved. Maybe the stuff that came from it  could help you more, here.

>wall
The paperwall is unmoved. Maybe the stuff that came from it  could help you more, here.

####test the Gird Grid

>x 1
The Poison Stripe surrounding the Same Mesa has caused people there to lose all sense of direction, physically and mentally. If one person could escape, that would change. The Oopsin' Priest may be able to help you.

>x 2
Spoiloplis was founded on self-help books, pyramid schemes, and other shady industries. Mayor Irv Lea lauds it as a center of positive thought. And not the nerdy brainy thought that goes into anagrams. You probably can't meet him, but maybe you can upset the social order.

>x 3
There is rumor of a Hacks' Shack immune to Elvira's SHATTER-THREATS legislation behind a near-nonsensical maze that may have you saying or thinking impolite words. In that Hacks' Shack, you may feel a sense of normality that gets you back to how things were before Elvira.

>x 4
A seashore seahorse mentioned a seaside dis-ease you need freaky fakery to avoid. Something about a hideout, and a gang called DIE THOU. Vigorous action is necessary, and a lot of it.

>x 5
The Bland Sad Badlands are not to be traversed lightly. People protecting their territory just because. Bandits sacking taverns for no reason. Castle Apcur, the Curst Palace, lies there, at the other side of Leak Lake. Condemned to be torn down to make a new MoneyCo office. Tax-free and all. Oh, and luxury condos endorsed by Avrile, that lifestyle maven. But if you could restore the palace somehow...

>x 6
Little is known about the region beyond Store T except that an Or-Not-O-Tron dissuades people from paying it much attention. It must be important!
