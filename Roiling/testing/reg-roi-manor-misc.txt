Aw, man, a third option for the settler wouldn't be fair. Trust me, it's powerful enough as-is.

You can just switch the slider if you want to manipulate it.

You don't have any special tricks with RETRYing. Just do so if you're in a store and stuck.

>warning
You can't change warnings. Warnings are there to protect you. Even offer hints if you read them.

>pedanto
You don't need to change the pedanto-notepad, except maybe by filling it up with ideas. But to do that, you need to take it, first. And you do.

!But to do that
