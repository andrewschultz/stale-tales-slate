The barley is nearly everywhere. Without knowing where you're going, you'll get lost.

>u
You can't go up here. In fact, you almost never have to go up or down in this game.

>belray
The barley rustles in an imaginary wind--but hardly at all.

>barely

>cinder
You'll need to change more than one cinder.

>e
The barley is a bit too thick that way.

Ed Riley booms, "Yielder! That's right. Go north. Not west."

Tapering Anger Pit
This north-south passage is frustratingly blocked.

A sly imp simply zooms about rangily guarding the way north, with a butlery air, showing legendary patience that allows vaster averts.

The sly imp lets out a curse. He's completely failed to keep his cool. He leaves, confidence shattered. You can go past now.

Tapering Inert Gap

 You run from a bunch of owls before they can carve at you

Those owls are too much for you, with your powers drained.

Cinders lie here

Ed Riley acts as a steward here to keep you eastward. He is carrying an ER, YIELD sign and a loaf of deli rye.

>take sign
"I am not an item yielder!" Ed Riley booms.

>eat rye
"I am not an item yielder!" Ed Riley booms.

>taste

>take rye

>sing
Unexpectedly, Ed pulls out a lyre from somewhere and yells "LYRE! DIE!" like he's in some medieval heavy metal band or something. He's really seeing red as he stomps it to dust.

>s
Ed Riley booms, "Yielder! That's right. Go south. Not west."

Shrewin' whiners are tallyhoing with great callosity here. They restyle why they can't let you go south.

>winhers
You can't change who whiners are, but maybe you can make them whine less...whiningly.

>loathingly
The din loses speed, energy, nastiness and volume. A re-count reveals several leavers. But even with them gone, too many are left blocking the way south.

>l
Shrewin' whiners are babbling with great callosity here. They restyle why they can't let you go south.

The whiners can't imagine why anyone would want to go there. They block you, for your own good. They seem to have all sorts of reasons, and there's no way past the quantity, if not the quality, of their arguments.

Slowly, conversation dwindles until it leaves every hassler rahless, slasher of noise. They find another place where rioters roister.

As they sulk away from the anteroom, they whimper about that bum Ed Riley who got a more exciting post than they did despite his moving so weedily. You're a bit sad you couldn't dispatch that loudmouth yet, but yay, working your enemies against each other.

>undo

"I will not re-yield! I am no longer a yielder! Ye Idler!" booms Ed Riley, and then he bangs on about not trying to sing or attack him.

He's not bigger than you, but his loud voice scares you. And he could probably swat you with either that deli rye or er, yield sign. You back away.

>x yield
"Spiffy, huh? I was told I could wipe off the "er" for the first person I scared into not passing me for good."

>x rye
It looks delicious enough for Ed not to share with you.

>reediyl
Ed Riley looks askance at his deli rye, as if it had some bad aftertaste.

>reedily
"Hey, man!" he mouths words silently for a bit, his booming voice gone. "Well--at least you didn't make me share my sandwich! That's...something!" he whines, as he slinks away in embarrassment.

>w
Gent-Fora Frontage

>despairingly
The macks become upset Gretta does not recognize just how swell they are--as a group, and individually. Gretta shrugs and shakes her head, maybe more at herself than the macks.

>drawlingly
The macks begin talking slower, and suddenly, their conversational hold is broken. Gretta realizes there's no good way to make home repair discussions more exciting and says so. She looks relieved.

>getns
They aren't (spiritually) gents, and you can't change them but their arguments.

>smack
(the macks)
They really, really deserve it, but keep your cool. Smack their arguments down instead and they may smack each other for you.

>mckas
Hm, you probably can't change the macks. They're dead set in their ways. Perhaps you can reframe what they are saying some more.

>mcka
If you messed with one mack, the others would gang up on you. Work on the argument, instead.

>modestly
Modesty is a good thing--well, in the long term. In the short term, the macks' backtracking is too brazen, and it ruins any hope of impressing anyone with false humility or braggadocio.

"Oh--um, yeah, don't feel you're holding me back. I sort of want to get away, but I know a few things that could help you," Gretta says. Stay and ask a bit more?

A very loud roar scares you. You doubt adverbs are up to the task of calming it. You decide to return once you have your full powers.

As they sulk away from the anteroom, they whimper about that bum Ed Riley who got a more exciting post than they did despite his moving so weedily.

Merle and Elmer look askance at each other for a bit.

>emler
You can't change Merle and Elmer, but maybe you could find a way to get rid of them.

>honestly
You entrench an enchanter with a well-timed "Honestly?" They throw out anti lying litanying but you're all "Few LOLs, fellows." It's not pretty, but their camaraderie's shattered. They begin squabbling about whom Elvira likes better. It's a welcome change.

You feel sort of clever finding what to do, but maybe you can be even cleverer, if you're a perfectionist and all. Discern anyway?
The medals look less than perfect. Maybe you can find someone, or something, to help. You should explore north or south of the barley.
