Tapering Anger Pit
This north-south passage is frustratingly blocked.

A sly imp simply zooms about rangily guarding the way north, with a butlery air, showing legendary patience that allows vaster averts.

Cinders lie here

Ed Riley acts as a steward here to keep you eastward. He is carrying an ER, YIELD sign and a loaf of deli rye.

>steward
Hm, you only managed to deal with adverbs so far, and steward doesn't have an L or Y. Maybe look at him for clues? Remember his name?

>asteward

>take rye
"I am not an item yielder!" Ed Riley booms.

>sing
Unexpectedly, Ed pulls out a lyre from somewhere and yells "LYRE! DIE!" like he's in some medieval heavy metal band or something. He's really seeing red as he stomps it to dust.

>s
Ed Riley booms, "Yielder! That's right. Go south. Not west."

Shrewin' whiners are tallyhoing with great callosity here. They restyle why they can't let you go south.

The din loses speed, energy, nastiness and volume. A re-count reveals several leavers. But even with them gone, too many are left blocking the way south.

Slowly, conversation dwindles until it leaves every hassler rahless, slasher of noise. They find another place where rioters roister.

As they sulk away from the anteroom, they whimper about that bum Ed Riley who got a more exciting post than they did despite his moving so weedily. You're a bit sad you couldn't dispatch that loudmouth yet, but yay, working your enemies against each other.

"I will not re-yield! I am no longer a yielder! Ye Idler!" booms Ed Riley, and then he bangs on about not trying to sing or attack him.

He's not bigger than you, but his loud voice scares you. And he could probably swat you with either that deli rye or er, yield sign. You back away.

>x yield
"Spiffy, huh? I was told I could wipe off the "er" for the first person I scared into not passing me for good."

>x rye
It looks delicious enough for Ed not to share with you.

>reediyl
Ed Riley looks askance at his deli rye, as if it had some bad aftertaste.

>deli
The sandwich isn't just deli, or rye, or a sandwich. It's deli rye
>yer
Yup! It's Ed's!
>rey
The sandwich isn't just deli, or rye, or a sandwich. It's deli rye
>snadwich
The sandwich isn't just deli, or rye, or a sandwich. It's deli rye

>reedily
"Hey, man!" he mouths words silently for a bit, his booming voice gone. "Well--at least you didn't make me share my sandwich! That's...something!" he whines, as he slinks away in embarrassment.

Gent-Fora Frontage

>bulwark
The whole bulwark? No, you couldn't do much with it at full strength

>despairingly
The macks become upset Gretta does not recognize just how swell they are--as a group, and individually. Gretta shrugs and shakes her head, maybe more at herself than the macks.

>drawlingly
The macks begin talking slower, and suddenly, their conversational hold is broken. Gretta realizes there's no good way to make home repair discussions more exciting and says so. She looks relieved.

They really, really deserve it, but keep your cool. Smack their arguments down instead and they may smack each other for you.

>mckas
Hm, you probably can't change the macks. They're dead set in their ways. Perhaps you can reframe what they are saying some more.

>mcka
If you messed with one mack, the others would gang up on you. Work on the argument, instead.

>modestly
Modesty is a good thing--well, in the long term. In the short term, the macks' backtracking is too brazen, and it ruins any hope of impressing anyone with false humility or braggadocio.
