#nudge for gol

The gaol is too sturdy to defeated by a three-word combination. Or a four-word one.

#nudge for gaol

The gaol is too much. It's built to resist you, and unlike the curst palace far away, it was never built to be something nicer.

#nudge for loggaol

Nah, you're pretty sure you're overthinking things now. You may want to open the prison.

#nudge for jail

It's not just any jail--but prison ropins.

Ew. Rats. You do feel like a waster, doing something with the waters. Perhaps the northern--or eastern--shore can work better.

#nudge for spray

The spray will still drown you if you don't figure a way to move somewhere.

#nudge for water
