If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.

>basemetn
The ten beams creak slightly. Maybe not all of them. But a few.

>basement
Now you remember why there were ten beams. Of course, the ten beams lead down to the basement.

You probably just want to go DOWN to the basement.

>ask tokers about elvira
"A bummer of authoritarianism, dude! She says her personality is all the drug you need!"
>ask tokers about xyzzy
The yawners aren't very answery, and you probably don't need a THC chat. They like you and all, but despite your adventuring, you'd never, like, invent a drug or do nothing as well as they do.
>ask tokers about store k
"Man, it was actually kind of sort of like fun in there. Until it wasn't."
>ask tokers about smoke cloud
"Er, free reefer!" they say. You'd probably have SOME sort of experience going through those fumes.

>nestor
>ask nestor about tokers
Nestor gives them a thumbs-up, they cheer drippily, and he cheers back.

>ask ian about ian
Before you can do anything with or to Ian, he thrusts a sheet of heartfelt reflections on drug use at you. "It will help you in ways you don't know. And even I don't know." Do you take it?
>ask ian about ian
The heartfelt reflections Ian gave you will say enough.
>ask ian about elvira
"She didn't get to her position of power by using DRUGS."
>ask ian about lecturer
"A great man. Listen to him, not me."
>ask ian about xyzzy
Before you can do anything, Ian points at the heartfelt reflections he shared on you. Or at you. But not just plain with you. He's so much bigger than you, it distracts you from whatever you meant to do.

>ask lecturer about ian
If he actually heard you, he'd yell a stunning rebuke to whatever he could pretend you'd say, then chalk your confusion up to drugs. You just want to get away from all this TEDIOUS stuff.
>ask lecturer about elvira
You probably know he's in favor of her.
>ask lecturer about lecturer
Oh, his good-for-society rant has enough of his own experiences sprinkled in.
>ask lecturer about xyzzy
If he actually heard you, he'd yell a stunning rebuke to whatever he could pretend you'd say, then chalk your confusion up to drugs. You just want to get away from all this TEDIOUS stuff.

He mentions he cannot do much--the Same Mesa needs magic to undo the curse, but the list-o-toils is on the wall.
>ask horbert about giant
"Well-meaning, but his wrath is misplaced. I can hear him from here. You may learn from listening to him, but there is nothing to fear."
>ask horbert about elvira
"Perhaps she was good once. But her influence on religion is...disturbing."
>ask horbert about xyzzy
Brother Horbert shrugs. "I should know more about the exotic outside world, but it's hard, with the poison stripe."

>ask brother horbert about spoon
"It may help you figure where to go."
>ask brother horbert about mantle
Brother Horbert shudders a bit.
>ask brother horbert about list-o-toils
Why not examine the list yourself?

There's not much dispute over the ownership. And the giant isn't trying to shoo you away. Maybe you should listen to the giant in general.

The giant is sort of controlling the conversation, and he's bigger than you. You probably just need to sympathize and avoid getting hit by flailing limbs and so forth.

He is already talking about himself, his complaints, and so forth.
