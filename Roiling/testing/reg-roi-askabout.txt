>lamp
Your score has just gone up by one point
>lapm
If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.

>basemetn
The ten beams creak slightly. Maybe not all of them. But a few.

>basement
Now you remember why there were ten beams. Of course, the ten beams lead down to the basement.
Your score has just gone up by two points
>basemetn
You probably just want to go DOWN to the basement.

>tokers

>ask tokers about tokers
"Missing our friend, man!"
>ask tokers about nestor
They weep at hearing the name of a lost friend.
>ask tokers about elvira
"A bummer of authoritarianism, dude! She says her personality is all the drug you need!"
>ask tokers about xyzzy
The yawners aren't very answery, and you probably don't need a THC chat. They like you and all, but despite your adventuring, you'd never, like, invent a drug or do nothing as well as they do.

>ask tokers about store k
"Man, it was actually kind of sort of like fun in there. Until it wasn't."
>ask tokers about smoke cloud
"Er, free reefer!" they say. You'd probably have SOME sort of experience if you went through those fumes.

>nestor
>ask nestor about tokers
Nestor gives them a thumbs-up, they cheer drippily, and he cheers back.
>ask nestor about nestor
Nestor mumbles about how his father is disappointed he didn't become a senator, just...he wants to just hang with his pals, if that's okay.
>ask nestor about elvira
"So bogusly repressive!"
>ask nestor about xyzzy
"Whuh, whuut? Try asking me about, like, stuff instead. Not, you know, stuff."

>ask nestor about store n
"Man, it was actually kind of sort of like fun in there. Until it wasn't."

#?? nestor/tokers twice in file?

>enter cloud

>ask ian about ian
Before you can do anything with or to Ian, he thrusts a sheet of heartfelt reflections on drug use at you. "It will help you in ways you don't know. And even I don't know." Do you take it?
>ask ian about ian
The heartfelt reflections Ian gave you will say enough.
>ask ian about elvira
"She didn't get to her position of power by using DRUGS."
>ask ian about lecturer
"A great man. Listen to him, not me."
>ask ian about xyzzy
Before you can do anything, Ian points at the heartfelt reflections he shared on you. Or at you. But not just plain with you. He's so much bigger than you, it distracts you from whatever you meant to do.

>ask lecturer about ian
If he actually heard you, he'd yell a stunning rebuke to whatever he could pretend you'd say, then chalk your confusion up to drugs. You just want to get away from all this TEDIOUS stuff.
>ask lecturer about elvira
You probably know he's in favor of her.
>ask lecturer about lecturer
Oh, his good-for-society rant has enough of his own experiences sprinkled in.
>ask lecturer about xyzzy
If he actually heard you, he'd yell a stunning rebuke to whatever he could pretend you'd say, then chalk your confusion up to drugs. You just want to get away from all this TEDIOUS stuff.

"None of your business."
>ask curtis about art erd
Curtis breathes deeply and gives a look of contempt and shakes his head. Curtis probably doesn't want to know if any fruit came from him.
>ask curtis about len
"A bit of a salesman, but he has some goods. Just--we're not on great terms, so maybe you can..."
>ask curtis about elvira
"She was terrible for business and innovation. Things are picking up again now, though."
>ask curtis about curtis
"Just trying to rustle up fruit and biotech business. Need to be growing more than iPrunes or those discussing yorpberries."
>ask curtis about xyzzy
"Ehh?" says Curtis. "I don't have time for small talk. More fruit, more fruit."

>ask len craig about curtis
"Nice fella, lots of ideas about agriculture, but no business sense. Just sits looking for someone to do his dirty work for him. You don't..."
>ask len craig about tekno-token
He inspects the token and says it's valid.
>ask len craig about art erd
Len snorts and shakes his head. "What a weasel."
>ask len about elvira
"Less said, the better."
>ask len about len
"I'm a businessman. A trader. Lots of stuff if you know how to haggle."
>ask len about xyzzy
Len proceeds to tell you how he was known as Icy Len til he started doing things nicely and even suggests you use nonverbal cues as a way to get an edge. It doesn't seem terribly relevant, but eh.
