The yawners aren't very answery, and you probably don't need a THC chat. They like you and all, but despite your adventuring, you'd never, like, invent a drug or do nothing as well as they do.

>ask ian about ian
Before you can do anything with or to Ian, he thrusts a sheet of heartfelt reflections on drug use at you. "It will help you in ways you don't know. And even I don't know." Do you take it?
>ask ian about ian
The heartfelt reflections Ian gave you will say enough.
>ask ian about elvira
"She didn't get to her position of power by using DRUGS."
>ask ian about lecturer
"A great man. Listen to him, not me."
>ask ian about xyzzy
Before you can do anything, Ian points at the heartfelt reflections he shared on you. Or at you. But not just plain with you. He's so much bigger than you, it distracts you from whatever you meant to do.

>ask lecturer about ian
If he actually heard you, he'd yell a stunning rebuke to whatever he could pretend you'd say, then chalk your confusion up to drugs. You just want to get away from all this TEDIOUS stuff.

Before you can pull a bar seat abreast... "Here's a hint, mac. GO HUNT A HANGOUT. Write that in your pedanto-notepad." He touches on the Die Thou Hideout in the Horned Hedron. An Absolute Lout Base. And the ghost that may be haunting the area. You congratulate him on his storytelling, but he says "Pff, nothing on this new novel of mine. Which I need to get back to. To which I need to get back."

Aunt Tuna ignores your specific question and instead launches into a tirade about innocent people not being able to hide from the Die Thou Hideout in the Horned Hedron, and what with the haunter running around, that's one more thing to worry about! And it would be nice if they could be played against each other, but the real world doesn't work that way, even though she TRIES to be optimistic.
