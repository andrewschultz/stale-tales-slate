You need a strong

You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant.

>pevtryo
There's no shortcut from poverty to the very top, but there's no definable state in between, due to the shrinking Yorpwald middle class. I'll spare the details.

>tevro
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

>spilo
You've got the right idea...sort of...but you're not worthy of big thoughts, yet.

>spilospilo
It looks like you tried to act on something doubly, possibly something that anagrams itself. To remove any future confusion, you should know you don't need to do that until after you defeat Elvira.

>potholes
City Hall can't fix potholes, and neither can you. You feel a bit of lost hope as you try. You need to look out for, and look within, yourself, here.

It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.

>gep
You pause, then note the author's middle initial, which seems annoyingly important.

Negative thinking! You don't need to focus on the cold but how to get rid of it. To generate heat.

That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a general list of verbs, type VERBS, or for options, type OPTIONS.

Babbling's babbling, but what stinks is, it's just so VERBOSE. Well, it doesn't stink that VERBOSE has fewer anagrams than babbling(s), settler or no, so that's something.

You think about the econ-cone being the recent center, but theorizing doesn't work. You need to look forward in other ways, to think of more concrete things, like how to be inspired by that statue.
