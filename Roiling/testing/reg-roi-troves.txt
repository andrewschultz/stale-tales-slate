Rathole

>real hot
You need a strong

>reahlot
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>pevtryo
There's no shortcut from poverty to the very top, but there's no definable state in between, due to the shrinking Yorpwald middle class. I'll spare the details.

>tevro
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

>tevros
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

>spilo
You've got the right idea...sort of...but you're not worthy of big thoughts, yet.

>spilospilo
You've got the right idea...sort of...but you're not worthy of big thoughts, yet.

>potholes
City Hall can't fix potholes, and neither can you. You feel a bit of lost hope as you try. You need to look out for, and look within, yourself, here.

>pothole

>pegagepa
It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.

>gep
You pause, then note the author's middle initial, which seems annoyingly important.

>geg
It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.

>epa

>cldo
Negative thinking! You don't need to focus on the cold but how to get rid of it. To generate heat.

>cldocldo
It looks like you tried to act on something doubly, possibly something that anagrams itself. To remove any future confusion, you should know you don't need to do that.

>crea
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a general list of verbs, type VERBS, or for options, type OPTIONS.

>htea
You think you feel less cold for a second. But you need to make it last.

>hate
by one point

>real hot
You needed a strong

>crea
Meh. Maybe you're closer than you think to motivation. How to make that matter?

>care
fretful truffle, which you
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip fretful truffle
Loudest Used Lot

>tuffler
You can't change the truffle. It can help you change things, though. Or how you see things.

>ludesto
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

>tlo
You should never need to riff on part of a location name

>sude
You should never need to riff on part of a location name

>broo
You can't change a whole suburb. Better to change yourself.

>gurb
You can't change a whole suburb. Better to change yourself.

>broobroo
You can't change a whole suburb. Better to change yourself.

>gurbgurb
You can't change a whole suburb. Better to change yourself.

>rustni
The ruts will pull you down if you look too far into them.

>urin
The ruts will pull you down if you look too far into them.

>urst
The ruts will pull you down if you look too far into them.

>babbligns
Babbling's babbling, but what stinks is, it's just so VERBOSE. Well, it doesn't stink that VERBOSE has fewer anagrams than babbling(s), settler or no, so that's something.

>babblign
Babbling's babbling, but what stinks is, it's just so VERBOSE. Well, it doesn't stink that VERBOSE has fewer anagrams than babbling(s), settler or no, so that's something.

>messhoel
A messhole is a messhole. You need to concentrate on thinking your way out.

>asidewalk
You can't make the sidewalk crumble any more, and you probably don't want to

>sidewakl
You can't make the sidewalk crumble any more, and you probably don't want to

>lida
You can't make the sidewalk crumble any more, and you probably don't want to

>weska
You can't make the sidewalk crumble any more, and you probably don't want to

>psto
You feel silly a bit. You can't let a simple stop post stop you!

>observe

>spot

>eliv
The bee's description isn't important. It's how you see the bee that matters.

>eeb
But it's not just any bee. It's an evil bee!

>eliv
The bee's description isn't important. It's how you see the bee that matters.

>eeb
But it's not just any bee. It's an evil bee!

>raclle
It's...hmm...you remember all the clues, but what order to place them in, now.

>deriev
It's...hmm...you remember all the clues, but what order to place them in, now.

>earson
The bee shakes its head, trying to make sense of the slightly disordered magic it felt from you.

>belieev
The bee's buzzing goes off-kilter for a bit. You gain a bit of faith you're on the right track.

>believe

>belieev
The bee's already taken enough of your in-my-heartitude.

>undo
>undo
>reason
>reasno
Too much fiddling with reason is unreasonable.

>recall
Pallid Li'L Pad

>egral
No...that is not quite the way to fight the temptation of the wicked brew.

>spired
The diapers, the sad pier--the spider only fits in as *a* spider.

>ictpure
It's not just any old picture. It's of a sad pier.

>despair

>bredomo
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

Rotunda

>brochuer
It's more the blurb at the end than the brochure.

>ratundo

>desrie
Your longing increases...but not enough.

>desire
Econ-Cone

>perky
If you brought down the skyscraper like that somehow, mass panic would ensue. Destroy it from within

>crass
If you brought down the skyscraper like that somehow, mass panic would ensue. Destroy it from within

>skyscraper
If you brought down the skyscraper like that somehow, mass panic would ensue. Destroy it from within

>skyline
You don't want to mess with the skyline. You want to get in the skyscraper!

>cnoe
You think about the econ-cone being the recent center, but theorizing doesn't work. You need to look forward in other ways, to think of more concrete things, like how to be inspired by that statue.

>cneter
You think about the econ-cone being the recent center, but theorizing doesn't work. You need to look forward in other ways, to think of more concrete things, like how to be inspired by that statue.

>staute
The statue can and should be changed for aesthetic purposes, but Trevis Vister's lawyers would be on you for sure. Maybe grok the writing on the statue.

>strive

>stateu
The statue can and should be changed for aesthetic purposes, but Trevis Vister's lawyers would be on you for sure. You could find another way to follow the statue's message, but it's not necessary.

>aspire

>stteua
The statue can and should be changed for aesthetic purposes, but Trevis Vister's lawyers would be on you for sure. You did what you could, anyway.

>undo

>bottel
It's not just any bottle, but a bottle of Pernod.

>alleb
It's not the label but what's on it.

>ponder
FiefCo Office

>eniso
Hmm, no, focusing so directly on the noise to block it out is counterproductive.

>divocre
If it was just one divorce, you could blow it off. Or there would not be enough to learn from. But there is so much drivel.

>magaznie
It's not just any magazine. It's DIVORCES!

>vainty
You don't need to deal with it as much as the person outside--but maybe examining will give you a clue.

>mpsal
You need that light for late-night work sessions.

>puctire
It's not just any old picture. There's a stream.

>sherka
The shaker itself's been around a while and can't be changed easily. Plus, what if it was a pepper shaker? Can't do much with that.

>ignore

>vainty
You really don't need to rearrange the vanity.

>vainty
You really don't need to rearrange the vanity.

>fren
The fern is mentally, if not physically, unmalleable.

>effi

>last
enough to last

>bostler
That's not quite the way to deserve that lobster.

>matser
That's not quite the way to focus on the stream.

>master

>last
Then, oh, man! You see there was a playbill under the salt.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]
You're besieged by art, in fact! What's...what's that sound? It's that song! By Eddie C.!

>lpaybill
You fold and look at the playbill many different ways before figuring it's probably the writing on it that matters.

>sgon
It's the song name--I'd Cede.

>edide
It's the song name--I'd Cede.
