Rathole

>real hot
You need a strong

#nudge for rathole
>reahlot
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

#nudge for poverty
>pevtryo
There's no shortcut from poverty to the very top, but there's no definable state in between, due to the shrinking Yorpwald middle class. I'll spare the details.

#nudge for troev
>tevro
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

#nudge for storev
>tevros
Trying to change the current region you're in would be risky, or useless, or maybe both.

#nudge for spoil
>spilo
You've got the right idea...sort of...but you're not worthy of big thoughts, yet.

#nudge for spoiloplis
>spilospilo
You've got the right idea...sort of...but you're not worthy of big thoughts, yet.

#nudge for potholes
>potholes
City Hall can't fix potholes, and neither can you. You feel a bit of lost hope as you try. You need to look out for, and look within, yourself, here.

#nudge for pothole
>pothole
City Hall can't fix potholes, and neither can you. You feel a bit of lost hope as you try. You need to look out for, and look within, yourself, here.

#nudge for pagepage
>pegagepa
It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.

#nudge for peg
>gep
You pause, then note the author's middle initial, which seems annoyingly important.

#nudge for egg
>geg
It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.

#nudge for pea
>epa
It's good to be on anagramming terms with the book's title, but maybe you would be better off feeling in tune with the author, because the author does seem to have a personal anecdote for every general principle.

#nudge for cold
>cldo
Negative thinking! You don't need to focus on the cold but how to get rid of it. To generate heat.

>cldocldo
It looks like you tried to act on something doubly, possibly something that anagrams itself. To remove any future confusion, you should know you don't need to do that.

>crea
That's not something you can say, do or see here. For a general list of verbs, type VERBS, or for options, type OPTIONS.

>htea
You think you feel less cold for a second. But you need to make it last.

>hate
by one point

>real hot
You needed a strong

>crea
Meh. Maybe you're closer than you think to motivation. How to make that matter?

>care
fretful truffle, which you
DEBUG INFO: Trying to flip fretful truffle

Bustle Sublet
#nudge for bustle
>subelt
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

#nudge for truffle
>tuffler
You can't change the truffle. It can help you change things, though. Or how you see things.

#nudge for boor
>broo
You can't change a whole suburb. Better to change yourself.

#nudge for grub
>gurb
You can't change a whole suburb. Better to change yourself.

#nudge for messhole
>messhoel
A messhole is a messhole. You need to concentrate on thinking your way out.

#nudge for asidewalk

You can't make the sidewalk crumble any more, and you probably don't want to

#nudge for askew
>weska

#nudge for stop
>psto
You feel silly a bit. You can't let a simple stop post stop you!

#nudge for sob
>sbo
No, you'll want to zone out the whole verbose distraction.

#nudge for veer
>vere
No, you'll want to zone out the whole verbose distraction.

>observe

#nudge for observe
>obserev

#nudge for live
>eliv
The bee's description isn't important. It's how you see the bee that matters.

#nudge for bee
>eeb
But it's not just any bee. It's an evil bee!

>raclle
It's...hmm...you remember all the clues, but what order to place them in, now.

>deriev
It's...hmm...you remember all the clues, but what order to place them in, now.

>earson
The bee shakes its head, trying to make sense of the slightly disordered magic it felt from you.

>belieev
The bee's buzzing goes off-kilter for a bit. You gain a bit of faith you're on the right track.

>believe

#dupnudge for live
>eliv
The bee's description isn't important. It's how you see the bee that matters.

#dupnudge for bee
>eeb

The bee's already taken enough of your in-my-heartitude.

>undo
>undo
>reason

#dupnudge for live
>eliv

#dupnudge for bee

>reasno
Too much fiddling with reason is unreasonable.

>recall

#nudge for spider
>spired
The diapers, the sad pier--the spider only fits in as *a* spider.

#nudge for pictuer
>ictpure
It's not just any old picture. It's of a sad pier.

#nudge for sda

It's a sad pier.

#nudge for pire

#nudge for glare
>egral
No...that is not quite the way to fight the temptation of the wicked brew.

>deal
Browse Bowers

#nudge for bower
>obwer
You should never need to riff on part of a location name

#nudge for bowers
>obwers
You should never need to riff on part of a location name

#nudge for brochure
>brochuer
It's more the blurb at the end than the brochure.

#nudge for rotunda
>ratundo

Your longing increases...but not enough.

Econ-Cone

#nudge for perky
>perky
If you brought down the skyscraper like that somehow, mass panic would ensue. Destroy it from within

#nudge for crass
>crass
If you brought down the skyscraper like that somehow, mass panic would ensue. Destroy it from within

#nudge for skyscraper
>skyscraper
If you brought down the skyscraper like that somehow, mass panic would ensue. Destroy it from within

#nudge for skyline
>skyline
You don't want to mess with the skyline. You want to get in the skyscraper!

#nudge for cone
>cnoe
You think about the econ-cone being the recent center, but theorizing doesn't work. You need to look forward in other ways, to think of more concrete things, like how to be inspired by that statue.

#nudge for recent
>cneter
You think about the econ-cone being the recent center, but theorizing doesn't work. You need to look forward in other ways, to think of more concrete things, like how to be inspired by that statue.

#nudge for statue
>staute
The statue can and should be changed for aesthetic purposes, but Trevis Vister's lawyers would be on you for sure. Maybe grok the writing on the statue.

>strive

#dupnudge for statue
>stateu
The statue can and should be changed for aesthetic purposes, but Trevis Vister's lawyers would be on you for sure. You could find another way to follow the statue's message, but it's not necessary.

>aspire

#dupnudge for statue
>stteua
The statue can and should be changed for aesthetic purposes, but Trevis Vister's lawyers would be on you for sure. You did what you could, anyway.

>undo
>undo

#nudge for bottle
>bottel
It's not just any bottle, but a bottle of Pernod.

#nudge for label
>alleb
It's not the label but what's on it.

>ponder
Upscale Capsule

#nudge for upscale
>upscael
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.


#nudge for noise
>eniso
Hmm, no, focusing so directly on the noise to block it out is counterproductive.

#nudge for divorce
>divocre
If it was just one divorce, you could blow it off. Or there would not be enough to learn from. But there is so much drivel.

#nudge for magazine
>magaznie
It's not just any magazine. It's DIVORCES!

>divorces
#nudge for divorces
>divorcse
No! Not another second thinking about that rubbish.

#nudge for vanity
>vainty
You don't need to deal with it as much as the person outside--but maybe examining will give you a clue.

#nudge for lamps
>mpsal
You need that light for late-night work sessions.

#nudge for lamp
>lapm
You already did something with a lamp, and you don't need to do anything with the plasm lamps.

#nudge for picteur
>puctire
It's not just any old picture. There's a stream.

#nudge for shaker
>sherka
The shaker itself's been around a while and can't be changed easily. Plus, what if it was a pepper shaker? Can't do much with that.

#nudge for ignore
>ignore

#dupnudge for vanity
>vainty
You really don't need to rearrange the vanity.

#nudge for fern
>fren
The fern is mentally, if not physically, unmalleable.

#nudge for sked
>dsek
The checklist was built to be especially stable and singular of purpose. So, nothing happens.

#nudge for office
>effico
You don't need to riff on any location names to win the game, unless there's not that much else to see. You may get a last lousy point from doing so in one place, if you're observant, though.

#nudge for fief
>effi
You should never need to riff on part of a location name, though you may get a last lousy point from doing so if you're observant.

>last
enough to last

>bostler
That's not quite the way to deserve that lobster.

>matser
That's not quite the way to focus on the stream.

>master

>last
Then, oh, man! You see there was a playbill under the salt.
[Your score has just gone up by one point.]
You're besieged by art, in fact! What's...what's that sound? It's that song! By Eddie C.!

#nudge for playbill
>lpaybill
You fold and look at the playbill many different ways before figuring it's probably the writing on it that matters.

#nudge for song
>sgon
It's the song name--I'd Cede.

#nudge for eddie
>edide
It's the song name--I'd Cede.
