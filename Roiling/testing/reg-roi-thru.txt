>lapm
You think you feel the palm shake a bit, but nothing terribly magical happens.
>lamp
Your score has just gone up by one point
>lapm
If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.
>palm
Maybe you could, but you will need the light. You won't need the landscaping.

>pedo
Yep. It's probably part of Elvira's reject-and-retreat, insinuating something without proving it. One of her "clever" games.
>pedo
Don't dwell on it. It's lies.

>basemetn
The ten beams creak slightly. Maybe not all of them. But a few.

>basement it
>stable it

>net
But the net would still block you.
>best name
Hm, you're pretty sure the beams guard something below. What's the best name for a room that's below? (You note the first and third squares on your settler turn purple as you think of the best name.)
>basement
Now you remember why there were ten beams. Of course, the ten beams lead down to the basement.
Your score has just gone up by two points
>basemetn
You probably just want to go DOWN to the basement.

Maybe if it weren't a giant pin. Well, giant enough to hide a wall safe.

You hear a sad-sax noise from the sitar. Well, a sitar version. "Rats, I..." you think, seeing red.

You need to change that to something else, then it'll be astir.

Meet-Bans Basement

>in
You fumble nervously

>chalets
You don't need a safe home, right now. You need adventure. Oh, and you don't have to switch that many letters, either.

>use notepad
The verb USE is a bit too nonspecific for the parser. You can SWITCH things, or OPEN doors. You should also be able to EXAMINE something you want to use, and the game should hint a verb.
!SCAN with

>satchle
You think you feel static through the latches. But they remain the same. Maybe there's some easy way to change them.
>satchel

all the secrets here
>satchle
You don't need to do anything more to the satchel--and if it became latches or something else, the settler would probably get messed up, too.

>paces
The space capes are already abstract and bizarre enough. They work, and you probably don't want to change them.

>use settler
The verb USE is a bit too nonspecific for the parser. You can SWITCH things, or OPEN doors, or SCAN with the settler. You should also be able to EXAMINE something you want to use, and the game should hint a verb.

Hands up!

>filer
You can't just give Elmo a desk job. Though maybe some paperwork would help.
>lifer
You start to educate Elmo about the penalties for murder, but he gestures at you like you've almost guessed a Charades clue or something.

>flire
Elmo bobbles the rifle slightly, and you think he may've nodded encouragement at you.
>mole
You can't change Elmo into an animal. Your powers don't work that way. But maybe he is a different sort of mole.
>flier
Your score has just gone up
>mole
You can't change Elmo into an animal. Your powers don't work that way. He already seems to be a different sort of mole.

Carven Cavern

>trainer
You're on your own. Perhaps you'd be better off scanning the plaster and twiddling the plates to get on with things.

>petals
That's already been done, and quite well, by Alan Garner in The Owl Service. If you haven't read his Brisingamen books, you should! They're not too long and very entertaining.

>pastel
The plates are more metallic. Plus, you are a text adventurer, not an interior decorator.
>pleats
You are a text adventurer, not a fashion designer.

>stapel
The plates shine slightly and rattle.
>staple
Your score has just gone up by one point
>stapel
Those plates were a mess, and now they're a tidy staple. It's better that way.

>psalter
You don't need prayer when you have this cool magic power.

>staplre
The plaster crackles and shines slightly.
>stapler
Your score has just gone up by one point
>staplre
The plaster was cracking anyway, before you made it a shiny stapler. You don't need to change it again.

>wallpaper
You try the word-flip, to check--sadly, it doesn't work. Maybe there is another way to remove the paperwall.

>put staple in stapler
The staple fits in with minimal fuss.

!You put the staple into the stapler.

DEBUG INFO: Adding a min point
>sorbte
You're a hero and all, but only one sample per day. Just think of the field day Elvira'd have if she found out!

>ergots
You're trying to rescue the people of Yorpwald, not give them fungus infections.
>go rest
Store G is too busy to allow that these days.
>gots er
And what would you do with Store G, when you take it?
>storge
You have a momentary vision of an apocryphal eighth book in the Harry Potter series sitting by a pillar, but it passes.
>storge
Stop trying to make Pillar of Storge happen.

>tosher
Insults will get you nowhere. You see red at thinking such a word

>throes
No, you are not in your last throes. Neither is Yorpwald. Try looking at the other end of the alphabet.

>hoster
That was sort of a given from the warning on Store H, as you note E. S. Roth's signature, and it is all in red. So none of those letters are in place. Hmm, what's a place/person that's been isolated?

>resort
You can't go back to the Roman Manor. Well, you can, but it's a bad idea.
>tortes
There's no time for food! Especially fatty, non-brain food!

>repost
That's not what you need to do with store P--you even see red trying to figure HOW you would.
>pteros
You don't need to face any predators.
>presot
You hear old forgotten magic words which seem like they might almost apply if they were in the right order.

You aren't close enough for such a weak word to affect the barley. But that seems right and worth writing in your notepad.
>depref

>ouster
It's your job to be the ouster in Store u, but how to get there?
>sureto
You'll be sure to figure it out sooner or later. You see red a bit at not quite being there yet.

Store U seems to light up with lines and curves for a second, but no, that's not quite right...

You see red at the possibility people might mess with your mind in whatever's behind store Y--especially after noting the TOYERS with the red line through in the window.
>troyes
Store Y does not lead to France.

>oystre
You hear grinding, then a slimy gulp, from store Y. But nothing definitive.

Store H looks totally different for a second.
>others

The hoster does look a bit weird, but you need to enter it, not change it.

>enter hoster
You think about entering, but you remember Elmo saying it wasn't critical to save Yorpwald.
>othesr
You've got an entry. No need to seal it up.

>stroke
You need a stroke of genius, but that's all wrong. You are left seeing red a bit. But this puzzle probably isn't worth risking your health over.

>tokesr
An odd sweet smell from Store K, for a second.

Your score has just gone up by one point

They are who they are. You should maybe try to get their friend back.

"Dude, you like must be close!" you hear from Store N.

"Hey, man! Don't depersonalize me! Or I'll throw something at you!" You hear from inside Store N.
>stoner
"Like, don't do it again, dude, or I will literally totally throw these empty bottles at you."
>stoner
The door to Store N opens, and two bottles whizz in your direction but nowhere close. They're bright red, and they appear to be lotions or something.

Ames, Iowa is less nowhere than here for sure, regardless what some wiseguys from rival Big Twelve schools might say. But you can't just up and leave.

You can't find any crack in the Same Mesa that you could follow.

Maybe if there were mango trees around.

####Pat's mistakes
>taps
You have no bugle. Well, not in this game.
>spat
Picking a fight--or spitting--is uncouth.
>psat
You have enough word juggling now. You don't need a standardized test, too.

Concerned parents won't be able to help you here.

You struggle a bit. The signboard should be pretty simple, being PAT'S. It'll come to you.

Idle Deli

>tap pat
You have Pat's attention, already, and he's not letting you in that seed pit without argument.

Pat doesn't need consolation for his lost business.

You don't need to attend any school board meetings.

>atp
No need for biochemistry, here.

You have no bugle. Well, not in this game.

Brother Horbert probably knows what to do with that.

The picturers were pretty strict about what they suggested. Not much else you can do with them.

You twist your mind a bit, but no, there's probably only one way to enter.
>ptsa
No, you don't see any other way around the signboard to enter. You don't need one, either.

Not quite the right way to position yourself, yet.

You hang around the bench, hoping for something to happen, but nothing happens. Though it seems like it should.

You leaned on the bench right. Time to get on it.

#quick early wrong tries
>under
You can't hide from the giant like that, right now.
>satired
Bad idea to poke fun at someone that much bigger than you.
>bowel
The giant's spouting enough verbal diarrhea, so, just... no.
Also, you don't need to go THAT far down.
>below
You're already below, but if you were close enough to listen, that could work.


>staider
Not only directions but mind games fail to work here. The giant will complain if he wants to.

Oof! You fail to jump on the bench end. Try mixing things up from what you just did.

"O, nice slur!" Elvira counters. "Cruel is ON!" Dang! She's come prepared with defense of her own too. I guess finding the redemption in all of us isn't the way to go, here.

>rule scion
Elvira smirks and shakes her head in disbelief. "I was expecting you to give up, but...no, you're not getting a post in my secret police for that. I mean, if I ever established any." She quickly makes sure nobody will remember hearing her slip-up.
QUIT, or UNDO the last command.

You wind up apologizing on national TV for getting too big for your anagramming britches and accepting a general brainwashing to boot. It's not that bad, only because, well, um, it just isn't. You're thrown in a jail, which can't be anagrammed, but it's for your own good. You're cool with that.
>undo
>prod it
You prod curiously at the machinery, and soon, Elvira realizes you don't have anything up your sleeve, and you won't be able to retreat in time. The purple pulper and the rest of her army subdue you easily.
