#spechelp for t-b
>basemetn
The ten beams creak slightly. Maybe not all of them. But a few.

>basement
Now you remember why there were ten beams. Of course, the ten beams lead down to the basement.
Your score has just gone up by two points

==t2
#done rejects for t-b
>basemetn
You probably just want to go DOWN to the basement.

==t2
#spechelp for palm
>lapm
You think you feel the palm shake a bit, but nothing terribly magical happens.

>lamp
Your score has just gone up by one point

==t2
#done rejects for palm
>lapm
If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.

==t2
#spechelp for tables
>stabel
The tables seem to shift a bit.

==t!1
>stable
DEBUG INFO: Adding a min point

==t2
#done rejects for tables
>stabel
You probably just want to go IN to the stable.

==t2
#spechelp for niche
>chimnye
Hm, no, the niche--my niche--won't unfold that way.

==t!1
>chimney
DEBUG INFO: Adding a min point

==t2
#done rejects for niche
>chimnye
You probably just want to go UP the chimney.

==t2
#spechelp for latches
>satchle
You think you feel static through the latches. But they remain the same. Maybe there's some easy way to change them.

==t2
#spechelp for giant pin
>paintign
The pin wobbles.

==t!1
>painting
DEBUG INFO: Adding a min point

==t2
#done rejects for giant pin
>paintign
The painting really goes better with the study than the giant pin.


>satchel
Your score has just gone up
==t2
all the secrets here

==t2
#done rejects for latches
>satchle
You don't need to do anything more to the satchel--and if it became latches or something else, the settler would probably get messed up, too.

==t2
#spechelp for sitar
>stari
You hear a sad-sax noise from the sitar. Well, a sitar version. "Rats, I..." you think, seeing red.

==t!1
>stair
DEBUG INFO: Adding a min point

==t2
#done rejects for sitar
>stari
You don't need to do any more with the stair.

#spechelp for pram

The pram creaks back and forth slightly.

==t!1

DEBUG INFO: Adding a min point

#done rejects for pram

The ramp is useful now. Best keep it.

#spechelp for rifle
>flire
Elmo bobbles the rifle slightly, and you think he may've nodded encouragement at you.

>flier
by one point

==t2
>flire
Better to pump Elmo for information.

#spechelp for plates
>stapel
The plates shine slightly and rattle.

>staple
Your score has just gone up by one point

==t2
#done rejects for plates
>stapel
Those plates were a mess, and now they're a tidy staple. It's better that way.

==t2
#spechelp for plaster
>staplre
The plaster crackles and shines slightly.

>stapler
Your score has just gone up by one point

==t2
#done rejects for plaster
>staplre
The plaster was cracking anyway, before you made it a shiny stapler. You don't need to change it again.
