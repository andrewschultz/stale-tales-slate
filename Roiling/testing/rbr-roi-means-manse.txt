#spechelp for palm
>lapm
You think you feel the palm shake a bit, but nothing terribly magical happens.

>lamp
Your score has just gone up by one point

==t2
#done rejects for palm
>lapm
If you mess with the lamp, at least you wouldn't see those idiots outside once they got in. But you couldn't run from them, either.

==t2
#spechelp for t-b
>basemetn
The ten beams creak slightly. Maybe not all of them. But a few.

>basement
Now you remember why there were ten beams. Of course, the ten beams lead down to the basement.
Your score has just gone up by two points

==t2
#done rejects for t-b
>basemetn
You probably just want to go DOWN to the basement.

==t2
#spechelp for latches

The pin wobbles.

==t2
#done rejects for latches
>satchle
You don't need to do anything more to the satchel--and if it became latches or something else, the settler would probably get messed up, too.

You don't need to do any more with the stair.

==t2
