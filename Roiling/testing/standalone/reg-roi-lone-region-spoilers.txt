The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something, in which case, one word (or a compound word) usually works.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: You need to change certain things to other things.

The parser had trouble understanding that (multi-word) command. While it's possible there's a more mundane reason, perhaps you were trying to change something.
So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: you need to change the stores, here, like you changed the palm, rifle, plates and plaster psalter, and you just need one word.

The region for this final command (Routes) may've changed since you last played, which is probably release 3 or earlier. Thus, significantly new stuff may've been added since then. Go ahead anyway?

So here is a one-time general guideline on what to do in this area: one word should work here, with no preface necessary. While one word is eight letters long, the rest are around five or six.
