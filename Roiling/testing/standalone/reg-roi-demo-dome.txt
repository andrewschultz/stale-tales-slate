There's nothing too tricky to do in the Demo Dome. You can THINK or request the SCORE to see if there's anything you missed. VERBS has limited utility, since there are no puzzles here.

If the names and ideas make you groan now, well, at least you didn't have to go through them to get here. You observe a page of former content:
