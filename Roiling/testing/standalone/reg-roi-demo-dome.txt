!There's no score in the Demo Dome. You just need to look around.

Are you sure you want to leave before looking at everything?

>x disport

>blather
There's nothing too tricky to do in the Demo Dome. You can THINK or request the SCORE to see if there's anything you missed. VERBS has limited utility, since there are no puzzles here.

Another thought reads: Finally, I'm just grateful I had so much fun exploring so many alleys and polishing so many odd things. I hope you had even half as much fun playing as I did writing the Stale Tales Slate.

That's the end of the Chronicle. You can read it again, if you want.
