Your settler registers ?YRY--hmm. Some of the spaces are blinking as if the settler couldn't tell what letters should be used. Maybe there are two ways to wangle things, or maybe the ambiguity is an extra clue. You could try re-scanning in non-cheat mode, or you can also HINT QUESTION MARK for a fuller explanation.
You can also enable clues for ambiguous/question mark settler-cheat readings with EXTRA. They give lateral-thinking hints that may be spoilers for some. You can disable them with TAXER or TAX ER. They are off by default.
Well, it's only four letters, and you're not sure whether to feel glad things start easy or to feel like your intelligence is insulted.

[NOTE: you can type PARSE for A Roiling Original to place information that can be deduced from a cheat-mode reading you more information at the top of the screen or SPARE to hide it. This is obviously a big spoiler, so PARSE is off by default.]

I guess it's a trope that something with a trope might help you with the general principles of when the settler is vague. Perhaps you can knock out one of the first two letters.

>poss
Switching on minimum/maximum available point notification in the status line.
[NOTE: this is a quasi-spoiler of sorts, since watching the maximum possible score drop means your most recent move precluded getting an easter egg. Or watching the minimum score increase may mean you found one.]

>score
You hear a points postin' piston rev up. It quickly drifts into background noise, fortunately not followed by the sound of combusting Pintos.
Ol' Stat Totals:
Score in a scenario: 0 out of 11 total points in the current region, Stores. Lowest score to solve is 3. Maximum score available is 11.
Won now: Ordeal Reload (0/15).
This would give you the rank of Riled Idler.

[NOTE: you can toggle seeing the minimum points to pass an area, or maximum achievable points, by typing POSS. This is a potential spoiler, since the minimum score increasing indicates you found a Last Lousy Point, and the maximum score decreasing indicates one is no longer available. But maybe you'd like that sort of hint, too.]

Disabling hints for the entirety of play is a drastic step, so NO HINT may be better than the drastic NOTHING. Do you still wish to disable hints completely?
