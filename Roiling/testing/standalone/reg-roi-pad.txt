"Oh, you should know--Gretta Garett-Tatger, the journalist, has become a target--sorry about that--for looking into Elvira's operations. Gretta may've left a hint in the Strip of Profits, and she may have something for you, if you find her. So, um, yeah, good idea, write that down."

A reminder that cussing won't make a computer work any better, and you need to get everything set up first on your comfy labs slab, and only then should you take action with various technical programming activities.

Those otters weren't standing guard for no reason. Elvira must be close. But you don't know what she's ultimately up to. You note in your pad it might be an extra good idea to ask about her, if people are around.
