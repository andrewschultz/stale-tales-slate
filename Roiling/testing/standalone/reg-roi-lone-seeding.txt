## reg-roi-seeding.txt: testing seeding for various puzzles
## specifically the towers/trefoil and otters/frontage
## the troves/upscale capsule randomization is here too
##
## This is different from the tests run in the RBR files, where seed=1
## and we place everything in the same room at once.
## Here we have a reasonable try that, in fact, a random seeding results in solvable scenarios.
