# back for tekno token or not (1st) * back for coin 1 or not (2nd) * back for coin 2 or not (3rd)

Curtis goes to take your bounty but backs off on seeing how much there is. "I, old as..." He snaps his fingers. "A solid load is laid, so! Lo, aids! Oi, lads!" he booms, and a couple assistants carry away your haul. "Do sail!" he exhorts you.
Curtis hands you another coin and a suspicious looking dollar. He nods as if to say, that's all you'll get from him.

"Spurtin' turnips! All that at once? I--well, here's the rest of my junk I don't know what to do with." Curtis, looking very pleased, hands you two coins and some sort of dollar.

"Wow! You got a lot done on that errand. Here's a Tekno-Token AND a coin. If you go to the clearing east of the wells, the token'll last you a bit. More deals. Coin'll be useful for...something."
A Tekno-Token. It's long since been Yorpwald's equivalent of a credit or debit card. It'll be handier than more classical currency.

"Surprised you can lug all that back! Here's a Tekno-Token to use in the clearing east of the wells, along with some coins. Maybe you'll find what to do with them. Keep it up!"
