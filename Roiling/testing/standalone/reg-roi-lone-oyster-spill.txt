The haunter-sausage points at the pills and wags its finger at you. It is beyond the help of medication. Perhaps it was killed off by medication and you were extra rude to remind it. Perhaps you can get the haunter to follow you just by walking around.

DEBUG INFO: Current oyster hint/spill item = yourself/yourself.

Unfortunately, the pills won't roll off and lead the way to where you need to go. You need some sort of map. One might be in your inventory, and you just need to examine it.
