!You don't have any special tricks with RETRYing. Just do so if you're in a store and stuck.

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-lalw
>llaw
You don't need to, and can't, do anything drastic to the walls when inside. That'd be kind of dangerous, anyway.

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-walls
>llaws
You don't need to, and can't, do anything drastic to the walls when inside. That'd be kind of dangerous, anyway.

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-elvira
>alvire
Changing Elvira is impossible, and you certainly don't want to summon her.

# must be done before using the TS command

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-paces
>epcas
Meta-commands don't have any easter eggs, sadly.

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-pedanto
>pedanto
You don't need to change the pedanto-notepad, except maybe by filling it up with ideas. But to do that, you need to take it, first. And you do.

#+ttc-table-of-general-nudges-pedanto
>pedanto
!But to do that

#above stuff needs to be done before/inside. Below can be done any time, or you need the settler

It's going to get evil enough even without a high-ranking COBRA officer.
[NOTE: you found a great guess, but such a change wouldn't push the story forward. Still, if you find one, the responses are meant to either be amusing or provide a small clue.]

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-settler

You can just switch the slider if you want to manipulate it.

Whenever you just try to too hard to think, things always get jumbled.

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-score
>cores

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-poss

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-listen

#ttc-table-of-general-nudges-something

SOMETHING never anagrams to anything, so you'll want to tinker with whatever that SOMETHING is on or near or supporting.

Alas, there is nothing between RESAVE and AVERSE to load a special game state.

>routes

>in

>orsca
you are on the right track, but the intended anagram has an extra S. This is a one-time nag, though the nudge messages should always implicitly state when things' or people's plurality, or an apostrophe-s, is important.
