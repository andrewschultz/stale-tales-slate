>ask basher about basher
Before you can do anything with or to the Rehabs Basher, he thrusts pamphlets labeled Help Stamp Hemp: SPLAT at you. "It will help you in ways you don't know. And even I don't know." Do you take them?
"Good choice. Say, if they're good enough, do you think I could become an even better blabber babbler than ... him?"
>ask basher about basher
"I'm nothing without Max Peel's help." This continues for a minute, after which you sort of wish the Rehabs Basher WOULD be, or say, nothing. How tedious.
>ask basher about elvira
"She didn't get to her position of power by using DRUGS."
>ask basher about babbler
The Rehabs Basher nods enthusiastically.
>ask basher about xyzzy
He nods at you and the blabber babbler. It's remarkably effective psychological warfare, to repress you and all.

>ask babbler about basher
If he actually heard you, he'd yell a stunning rebuke to whatever he could pretend you'd say, then chalk your confusion up to drugs. You just want to get away from all this TEDIOUS stuff.
