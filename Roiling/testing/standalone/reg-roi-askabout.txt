Elmo waves his rifle at you. Funny, you'd have expected much more aggression from someone Elvira sent to imprison you.

Before you can do anything with or to the Rehabs Basher, he thrusts pamphlets labeled Help Stamp Hemp: SPLAT at you. "It will help you in ways you don't know. And even I don't know." Do you take them?
"Good choice. Say, if they're good enough, do you think I could become an even better blabber babbler than ... him?"

"I'm nothing without Max Peel's help." This continues for a minute, after which you sort of wish the Rehabs Basher WOULD be, or say, nothing. How tedious.

>ask casper about elvira
Before you can pull a bar seat abreast... "Here's a hint, mac. GO HUNT A HANGOUT. Write that in your pedanto-notepad." He touches on the Die Thou Hideout in the Horned Hedron. An Absolute Lout Base. And the ghost that may be haunting the area. You congratulate him on his storytelling, but he says "Pff, nothing on this new novel of mine. Which I need to get back to. To which I need to get back."

Aunt Tuna ignores your specific question and instead launches into a tirade about innocent people not being able to hide from the Die Thou Hideout in the Horned Hedron, and what with the haunter running around, that's one more thing to worry about!
