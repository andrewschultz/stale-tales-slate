>retry
You haven't been to the Strip of Profits yet, whatever that is, and you suspect you can't just jump ahead. Besides, you don't want to risk retrying the Means Manse.

########################################################Big Patcher Test

* plow-thru

>{include} _to-strip
>abstract patcher to strip
>get patcher
It'd be kind of hazardous to carry around. You can just ZAP whatever's left.
>zap store k
As you point the patcher at Store K, you hear cries of "No, man! Don't harsh our buzz!"
There are people in there. Store K may not be where it's at, according to Elmo, so that's even more reason not to disintegrate it.
>zap store n
As you point the patcher at Store N, you hear cries of "No, man! Don't harsh my buzz!"
There are people in there. Store N may not be where it's at, according to Elmo, so that's even more reason not to disintegrate it.
>tokers
>nestor
>zap nestor
You're a text adventurer, not a drug enforcement agent.
>zap tokers

>zap store u
take care of things behind Store U
>undo
>routes
>zap routes
obliterates the routes

>zap store v
take care of things behind Store V
>undo
>troves
obliterates the troves
>zap troves

>zap store p
take care of things behind Store P
>undo
>presto
>zap spot
obliterates the, er, spot

>zap store y
take care of things behind Store Y
>undo
>oyster
>zap oyster
obliterates the oyster

>zap store w
take care of things behind Store W
>undo
>towers
>zap towers
obliterates the very tall towers

>zap store t
The energy you felt from the patcher seems to bounce off Store T and zap you back. You'll have to be a tough customer to enter Store T.
>otters
>zap otters
The energy beam that emits from the patcher fizzles as it hits the otters. Whatever's behind the otters is likely no joke.
