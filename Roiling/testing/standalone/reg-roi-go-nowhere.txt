As you try to flee the Strip of Profits, a voice boomes "Run off for fun? Urff, no!"
Up pops a bush--a hubs bush! It's too thick to walk through. You move to the side, but the bush expands. Defeated, you turn back to the center--and when you look around, you notice the hubs bush encircles the whole Strip of Profits. Guess you'll need to explore the stores.
