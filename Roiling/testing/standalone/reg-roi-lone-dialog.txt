The dope op-ed is broken into several pages. It's by Elvira, and it's apparently tackling you on your own ground. The pages are labeled nitro-intro, questin' inquest, MoneyCo and Economy, Shatter-Threats, I Trash His Art, and By Li'l Billy.

>x inquest
It's headed Good deeds? Sodded ego! Elvira lays out how you saved Yorpwald and all. But everyday stuff? You couldn't repair a flat tyre with flattery, make custard out of car dust or spumoni from an ion sump. Or even a cellphone from cellophane.

You pause. That's so contrived. What kind of faker-freak would think that up?

>x questin
The Questin' Inquest page is no less annoying the second time around.

>x moneyco
Elvira notes Yorpwald's more profitable than ever!

>x economy
Elvira notes Yorpwald's more profitable than ever!

>x i trash

Elvira offers an apology for not seeing to the heart of the matter about all your anagramming. Oh, sure, she had clever opinions about whether obvious anagrams were better than non-obvious ones, and she changed around, and she's glad people found them interesting, but really, it's kind of nerdy now that your good deeds were DONE. All kinds of examples, ahead.

>x i trash
Elvira lists games that don't make kids or concerned parents happy. Mega Mage Game (e-mag: a gem!) as well as many others:

She blames you for the games' technical and aesthetic faults, mainly due to the anagram craze you never quite discouraged.

>x i trash
Elvira discourses on rap music. "Rap music is, um, crap. Funky? F'n yuk! Pop stars, stop raps!" She lists D.J. JD as even worse than
Geez! So many horrible "musicians." The "hits," too.

>x i trash
Elvira has harsh words for other genres, yet they keep cranking things out!

>x i trash
Elvira ravages the rigidness of music in general. All the latest...hits.

>x i trash
Elvira "begs the question" of who is getting a lot of royalties! Someone probably in a nice cosy hidden manse! She finishes by berating the Klaw Walk and Bungie Beguin as dumb dances.

>x i trash
Elvira shows little respect for comedians like

"Yeah, sorry about the lamp." You say no worries--you're trying to figure what it means. Elmo doesn't judge. "Yeah, you been under stress, I bet, let's work it out." The settler vaguely goes red, yellow/green, red and red near the fragments. "Hm, cheat mode changes A from yellow to green. That must mean something."

Elmo checks you for a second. "You sure you know how to use the settler?"
You nod. "No clues counsel."
"Oh, you should know--Gretta Garett-Tatger, the journalist, has become a target--sorry about that--for looking into Elvira's operations. Gretta may've left a hint in the Strip of Profits, and she may have something for you, if you find her. So, um, yeah, good idea, write that down."

A pause. "Go, you doer. You're good. Un-retire, reuniter. Re-shift it fresh. Disable bad lies. There's an evac-cave over thataway. You'll know what to do. I think. Forsake fears, ok?"

Elmo hands you an additional note--a Gird Grid--to help you on your way. He also notes it's worth reading red writing and trying to get by enemies in your way, even if they're too big. You'll see clues.

You leave, feeling less resave-averse, but run as you hear "Get Elmo!" / "Get ol' me? Let me go!" "Sympathy?" / "My hat, spy!" ... "A spy yaps, pays..."

You crawl through the evac-cave, which exits to writing behind a dune, man. UNNAMED: MUNDANE, but you look closer and see RETRAIN TERRAIN in a font that feels rantier. Behind is a Carven Cavern. It looks as good a place as any to visit.

Elmo notes that individual letters can be either red-or-purple or yellow-or-green. All green letters in cheat mode were yellow in non-cheat, and the same for purple to red. Then the ones that are purple/green--are in the right place.

Elmo thinks a minute and notes red plus blue is purple, and yellow plus blue is green.

[2] Hmm, I don't see what orange means.

"Excellent! So, yeah, the settler adds blues when you're in cheat mode and the letters are right. Purple consonants, green vowels." Elmo looks over your settler once more. "Hmm. What's the orange for? On Yorpwald/wordplay?"

[1] Yeah, I see what orange means.

You examine the backside of the settler and note how Yorpwald lines up with Wordplay--those two orange letters stand out a bit. Then you both realize both orange letters go to a Y that's not in the right place.

You've sort of heard it, and you've sort of thought it, but yeah. She really did backhand-compliment you (not bad for boring old mathy stuff, but you did the job, she guessed) while saying people needed someone more exciting to mythologize about.

Like, gosh, HER! "Her united con continued unnoticed. But it's too perfect. Tough to--ugh. Something messes up, she denounces it right away. SHATTER-THREATS is so specific to you, too. That's why I don't like it.
