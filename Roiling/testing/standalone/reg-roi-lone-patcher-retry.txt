>retry
You haven't been to the Strip of Profits yet, whatever that is, and you suspect you can't just jump ahead. Besides, you don't want to risk retrying the Means Manse.

It'd be kind of hazardous to carry around. You can just ZAP whatever's left.
>zap store k
As you point the patcher at Store K, you hear cries of "No, man! Don't harsh our buzz!"
There are people in there. Store K may not be where it's at, according to Elmo, so that's even more reason not to disintegrate it.
>zap store n
As you point the patcher at Store N, you hear cries of "No, man! Don't harsh my buzz!"
There are people in there. Store N may not be where it's at, according to Elmo, so that's even more reason not to disintegrate it.

>zap nestor
You're a text adventurer, not a drug enforcement agent.
>zap tokers
You're a text adventurer, not a drug enforcement agent.

The energy beam from the patcher bounces off the solid idols and almost zaps you and the patcher back. Whoever or whatever is behind the solid idols must be very powerful indeed.
