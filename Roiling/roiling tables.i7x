Disgusted that nobody will listen any more, he throws Rude [']N Nuder in the air. The slip-on cover rips! It falls away to reveal a different book ... [i]Runner Dude[r], by Nurene Rudd and Derrun Edun. Wait, no! That's another false cover. The book's real title is [b]U NERD: ENDUR (REDUN)[r]!

Athewart--helps you navigate around tough bits. You look around. Oh, hey, there's the mast and stuff. And though you're in an underground cavern, there are--well, not quite stars, but markers that can help guide you to the free reef, if you need the extra direction.

raptest patters	raptest patters	false	575888338	--	"without"	"without"	"It's always tough to figure how to ignore stuff. Do you focus on it directly, to find a way to get rid of it, or do you try to block it out? Either way, you realize that you just want to be without that sort of drivel, and ... amazingly, when you think of the more important things you have to do, it goes away."
yob den	yob den	false	432873440	Strip of Profits	"beyond"	"beyond"	"You ignore the yob den. That'll sort itself out later. What's important is to find a way out, back to the surface. And you do... it's much quicker than you'd think! You turn around, and there's the yob den, cheering for you. A drama armada is also there, applauding you. You realize you're just outside of the poison stripe, and it turns a final shade of bright green before it winks out and vanishes. 'Pardone...a pro end! One, pard!' It's Brother Horbert. 'These other people, well, they promoted me to an Aproned Padrone. I hope I'm up to it.

As her voice crackles off, pins spring up to shield the dialer from further operation, and the dialer quits humming.

As he walks away, he mutters some interesting, lucid points that make you feel better about needing or using the settler and quest aides in general. You get the sense if you ever made a game yourself, he'd give some pretty awesome work and advice. You could even picture him helping create a gadget like the settler.

I...old-age gaoled...' / 'Ah, told.' you say, writing the information in your notepad.[wfak][paragraph break]You follow his directions, apparently towards a voice booming 'Stop! Die!'

It is back to what it was and more! [what-about-ed]. You are treated to a great banquet in the castle hall before one of the local wizards offers you a chariot. Not just any one. A Raci-Hot, shaped like a haricot. As you're driven back to the Strip of Profits, you see so many things as they should be. The Bland Sad Badlands are already on their way back to being the Mild Sand Midlands. The towers crumble as you fly back through to the Trips Strip."

"Part one: Protean[paragraph break]There's no compelling personal story here. I just had fun trying to make the sort of game I'd have liked when I was younger, the sort Infocom might've done better if the Apple didn't have its limitations.[paragraph break]This part maps how ARO was part of Shuffling Around at first, til I realized that'd be too long for IFComp's two hours. You see how the game started with the stores, how there was F, I, U, V, W and Y, with P being the finale, and how store M didn't exist for a while. In fact, Store R got finished at the very last. It relates how OUTSIDE was the original puzzle until the author realized that was too abstruse, thanks to a tester, and it maps how F and I were first, so they go the good stuff--the nouns--before M started developing. Somewhere along the line, too, I decided to go in for an anagram of Psuedonym. Moe Spudny, Spud Money, Don Muspey and Ed Spumony all seemed amusing, but it wasn't until I remembered a character I wrote for a walkthrough of Deathlord, Ned, that I started poking around. Yompus may not be a real last name, but it sounds like one. So I went with it. Finding it was one of those 'click' moments that didn't solve any technical problems, but it felt cool.[paragraph break]Plus, Andrew Schultz doesn't really anagram well, except to CRAWLS, ZEN, THUD."
"Part two: Wrapt to[paragraph break]I realized that it was probably best to go with nouns-to-nouns. Well, until the last puzzle. This kicked out all but F and I. I didn't know what else to do, or where the finale would be. I eventually decided on R, once I figured a resort would be a good place. It only had the Means Manse, and you just had to EXIST. I think your enemy was Too-Apt Pa Otto, and you had to make him into a POTATO. But that was a bit mean. Then METROS began to take shape, and I liked the underside and hotel, and then other locations fell into place."
"Part three: Trap there? Er, phatter[paragraph break]The big problem I had was that I couldn't disambiguate how to flip items, and I had no encouragement for guesses for anagrams. This was a pretty big fault, and there were others, too. Nevertheless, I found a lot with the help of my testers, and I even had the bright idea of trying to provide an alternate way through Metros. One sub-try got the player stuck. Nevertheless, I was able to identify ways to take care of this throughout the comp, and I had plans for post-release stuff. Every mistake I made served to give me an idea to make things easier for the player. The game needed it. I also settled on the idea for the new hint device. I didn't want to reuse what I had from SA, but I also wanted to make things simpler and more powerful. People had trouble seeing if they could take both devices, so I merged them. And I started on the settler, once people said they wanted something a bit more Master Mind like."
"Part four: tap furor[paragraph break]Nobody was really furious at the game, but I certainly got to work when I learned about David White's hashing. Immediately it made ARO more accessible, in theory. I had a lot to whip into shape. I tried to fix a few things per day. I was disappointed in the bigger mistakes I made, and after getting SA into a decent beta (or so I thought,) I started on ARO."
"Part five: pave rift[paragraph break]The only problem was, once I got back to ARO, it didn't make sense. I had an idea that nouns would only feature in the intro. Oyster was just entering a house and leaving. Routes didn't let you underground. Troves--well, I didn't get the concept of what it should be in the first release, though I had a few passive verbs. I had to look through my master document of anagrams, and I found that a lot I dismissed as too simple wound up fitting just right, and testers particularly liked them. I also figured on interjections for Presto as the last area, because interjections are EXCITING. Towers--well, more on that later. I also wasn't sure what to do with OTHERS, which I had after the Means Manse and before the strip. I eventually decided to chuck it for release 1, as it wasn't as good an introduction as I thought. The diorama was created 2 weeks before 2013 Spring Thing, and I think it was relatively successful. But I left so much to do at the last minute with exiling a region I'd worked on that I missed some big things."
"Part six: star pix[paragraph break]I had hoped to put graphics into the game, and it turned out trickier than I thought. Thankfully Glimmr for Glulx works pretty well, but I would up losing valuable time not using the fonts correctly, due to a dumb mistake. I also failed to stop a buffer overrun in some cases, but that's another story. This was something automation could not catch. I also experimented with some pictures and colored text (Yorpwald/wordplay) but didn't get cover art. I couldn't think of anything simple."
"Part seven: vaster pen[paragraph break]The big problem, though, was what to do with Towers. Originally they were a mess of anagrams like STANCH and CHANTS you had to guess, and you got clues of what was where, and some choices were good and some were evil, and you hacked through the Thickest Thickets. One guy, Elmer, was good, and Merle was evil, and the Coevals['] Alcoves had an elevator where you could go to the various floors and try puzzles. I liked this when OYSTER was small, but Oyster started getting bigger, and Towers became too abstruse with its actions.[paragraph break]It did have hinting, though, and this hinting eventually got repurposed more powerfully and elementally to the settler, but until then, it was a mess. I figured adjectives would be the trickiest things to look at, but a look through my master document gave a lot. At least they weren't as bad as adverbs. I couldn't do anything with them, right? Adverbs were so--powerless."
"Part eight: that gripe, gather pit, tiger path[paragraph break]And that's when it hit me--I could just GREP my anagram file for ly\b, or words that end in LY, and of course you could be powerless near your great foe. The bleary barley came first, then a way to regain your powers--conjunctions were another word that could be very powerful. Then I noticed a slew of animals which hadn't been anagrammed, mostly because I didn't see how to in SA without crowding the game. Things started to click. I even had an enemy to defeat, but she had no character or name. The necro-crone wasn't Elvira til after Spring Thing."
"Part nine: inert nap, pain rent[paragraph break]I was able to get the game working with a walkthrough, and I submitted it okay. Greg Boettcher noted it worked, and he liked the idea, though he diplomatically noted that the walkthrough's cuing helped (translated, this meant I forgot to cue SEVERAL exits.) I found a few easy bugs post-release and didn't see any reviews for a while. I was at least glad one liked the pedanto-notepad. But I was still frustrated. I was grateful to place second to a very entertaining game (Geoff Moore and I have since helped each other with other works,) and I knew I wanted a post-release fix, but I didn't know the scope. What probably kicked me in the butt was an email from someone named Toby Ott who thanked me for the game. He explained he was blind and liked games like this, but he'd found a few bugs. This moved me from 'I better fix my mistakes' to 'I can make this better for people who like this sort of thing.' I also saw a very good walkthrough with bug reports from David Welbourn. I was happy to note I'd fixed some of the bugs, but he provided cuing beyond the good stuff my testers found, including some help-code that hung the game. I think what they found helped him be able to find stuff without getting TOO frustrated. But again, it was nice people were PLAYING."
"Part ten: pet rant pattern[paragraph break]I thought I'd get the first release out before IFComp 2013, but there were always new bugs to find or puzzles to touch up. I'd fix an area, then move to the next, then be sure the area was paved over smoothly--only to find several 'I saw that, right?' issues. The thing was, there was so much I needed to do, I couldn't get down to the fun aesthetic stuff in good conscience. Eventually I decided on a drop-dead release date early in 2014, but unfortunately I couldn't get to some good transcripts. I left some huge bugs in--ones my testers found--but release 2 made a lot more sense."
"Part eleven: nerve leapt. Vent. Repeal[paragraph break]One of the huge problems I had with testing was the inefficiency of adding one anagram. But with the major issues out of the way, I found ways to do stuff better. How to add names to anagram checking. This caused my bookshelf to add 1000 titles for release 3 and let me name all the authors. I found a way to centralize all the anagram tables so you could see them at the end. I thought I wouldn't use it much, but I wound up adding ten tables more. I used Notepad++ to load quickly and add anagrams when I didn't need to compile, and for my own vanity, I tracked the number of anagrams in the randomized tables and even checked if they conformed to Benford's Law and Zipf's Law. I wrote an anagram-checker. PERL even helped me to detect bad punctuation, capitals or quotes. All this helped me focus on technical stuff. There's so much I thought I'd only use once, but I reused it. All sorts of internal checks (like the tables of anagrams and David White's hashes--in some cases, I wasn't checking right) cleared up. The Table of Nudges grew by several hundreds as I wrote a program to check for the hash value and dump it in a text file for later use. I even managed to write a silly program to check the relative difficulties of the areas. Towers is, by far, the toughest. But I think the most important thing I did was to try and play through one or two areas seriously per week. I needed to let testers['] suggestions soak in. Some puzzles, I thought, weren't perfect, but I didn't have better. But I would up cleaning them up later."
"Part twelve: twerp valet varlet wept[paragraph break]It turns out there's nothing here that was any good, but I liked this sentence."
"Part thirteen: inert? Phatter! Prettier than...[paragraph break]Just having time pass and being able to tighten up puzzles and think of things has been revealing. I write down my notes, look them over, and get on with it. I've never worked as hard at a creative project as I did with this game, but so many times I thought I'd run out of things to do before finding one more. While I figured 'Demo dome mode' shortly before release 2, I never got around to it because there was always something else in the game."
"Final part: plan a rift[paragraph break]I'll have to move on. I had fun with this game as a thought experiment. I enjoyed looking at a phrase, saying I bet that'll anagram, and being right. I also enjoyed finding that a simple anagram could fit nicely in the game's flow. But it all has a diminishing return to scale. I want to move on, but hopefully I'll be able to add new silly books or dialogue on a whim. Github makes it easy to add things--and I wish I'd had it earlier, so I could've tracked other changes. Oh, and if people find bugs (still) I can roll that up, too."

Other commands include jumping to the Strip of Profits, clearing all but Otters, and even jumping to just before the Gates Stage."
"You stare at the start of the Tables of Nudges. There's, like, 1000+! That's over double Shuffling Around! The numbers look confusing and arbitrary, but you recognize the anagram-strings that the game checks for, as well as how room anagrams seem to point to the same error messages. You even see how they were broken into regions, and a region has a table name called table of routes anagrams/nudges, and so forth."
"You stare at the start of the Table of Random Books. Wow, [number of rows in table of random books]! That's a lot of books! The second column seems to give a book a priority, so the player is likely to see certain ones first. Those seem to cover certain puzzles that occur later. It seems like a lot, but there's a note that it was well over two years, and the author just wrote a few neat words from each book to poke at."
"You see some specialized Inform 6 code from Zarf (again,) Climbing Stars (in more than one place--for disabling TRACE for the Oyster puzzle, and for restarting the game after winning) and other people."
"You see a bit more Inform 6 code the author scratched out himself. The main chunk is at https://www.intfic.com/t/i6-stubs-for-i7-programmers/83/6."
"You read more various miscellaneous testing commands, like ones that zap all the guardians, see all the fruits or even show what the player would've missed or alternate paths every move."
"You stare at the various tables of random text. A voice from behind a fourth wall mentions they used to be in lists, and worse, not even alphabetized so that some duplicates could be caught easily."

"#generating silly names with honorific titles cheaply[line break]for ($x in %firstNames) { if ($isLastNameAnagram{alf('$x$ext')}) { print '$ext $x $isLastNameAnagram{alf('$x$ext')}'; # print for instance Mean Roy Maroney"
"$alf = join('', sort(split(//, lc($a)))); if ($ana{$alf}) { print '$a=$ana{$alf}'; } $ana{$alf} .= ' $a'; # anagram find code"

"if (firstWord($a) eq firstWord($last) { print 'Possible duplicate: $line, $a = $last.\n'; }"
"There's a reference to http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=17095 which describes how to detect orphan text in Inform source."
"The perl code is a bit complex, but it seems to involve reducing strings to smaller things. #Mega Mage Game = a3e3g3m3."
"if (($startsWithCapital{$currentTable} == 1) && ($thisString =~ /^[bracket]a-z[close bracket]/)) { print 'Bad capitalization!' # other test cases for if it's -1 (needs to start with lower case) or 0 (doesn't matter) and there are even tests for quotes or punctuation at the end."
"Below the code for reducing strings are various comparisons to detect if an anagram has been used, if a book anagram is proper, or if the book matches its author(s)."
"In the book/author notes, there's a few comments about 70% had matching names before the try, and 10% just had bad anagrams, before that was all fixed. And many former author names were shipped off to Shuffling Around to make room for new ones here."
"while ($a = <A>) { if (($a =~ /@ARGV[bracket]0[close bracket]/) && ($a =~ /@ARGV[bracket]1[close bracket]/)) { print '$a matches.'; } } # simple check for if I wrote something already"
"There's simpler code below just detecting if any anagrams are found in table entries. It's tough to follow, with exceptions for if two of the same word are in an entry, with the same hash as above."
"There's code of what appears to be copying critical files to a GitHub directory. Shuffling Around and Roiling files are sent to sister directories, along with the compiled release binaries and lots of utilities."
"The rest is too archaic, but it includes other things I put on [my-repo] include scripts to verify random text anagrams, to create the cheat and non-cheat text in the settler, and even track geometric means of table lengths."

table of observations
obser [from chic loner chronicle] [tdm4]
"I found so many ridiculous anagrams just reading a book on the way to work, or working out, and then I'd just feed them into the anagram server. If ten thousand seems like a lot, well, that is over two years, so that is fifteen per day. That is not so bad when you consider one takes a minute, and I can waste a lot of time in any case."
"One of the best parts of using the anagram server was that I kept seeing cool quotes on the right. These added up to ideas for future games, or even funny jokes, or even more authors to read. It's always a treat when one project gives you spin-off projects."
"A simple I <3 BLOCKSITE FOR FIREFOX. AND GOOGLE CHROME. Well, that's not very philosophical or motivational, but it could be practical."
"It's difficult to describe when an idea has critical weight to branch out. For things like the responses to waiting or blank commands, I maybe had a few in one of/or loops, until I sat down and concentrated on words that meant doing nothing. It took a while to find, but once I had, say, six, I sat down and tried to stretch it to ten, when I put it in a table for the player to see at the end."
"Many of my ideas come from everyday things. I didn't pay religious attention to my file of anagrams once I put down the initial puzzles. However, having two testers say, this seemed a bit wobbly, got me thinking. There were puzzles I liked, and I recruited the best talent available, so to speak. But like on a sports team, the most impressive athlete doesn't necessarily fit. It was hard to retire favorite anagrams or demote them, but it was necessary. And I got some good mileage with ones I'd passed up because I thought I had enough good ones. The diners in release 3 are probably the best example of this."
"It wasn't until I established an assembly line for writing things up that I really started getting the anagrams in place. Before, I sent things to my daily writing, which sorted ideas to a big file by region. Once I cemented ARO as a big project to dedicate time to directly, I didn't have that hurdle, and things went faster."
"I'm still amazed how much organization helped me. Before, I might see an anagram and wonder where it went. Once I organized the anagram types into the Table of Megachatter, it became a lot clearer what would go where, and I could add a new category if I wanted. The one of/or constructions--where things cycled every three times you observed--billowed out to tables. As did lists, where it was tough just to insert one idea. I figured how to make a final note, too, before cycling."
"I even found it easy to add new or break-off tables. For instance, the schematic catechism (one of the last anagrams I wanted to do something with but I didn't know what) originally just had random ideas. Then it had research topics. Then it had Brainy People. Again, none of this would've happened if I hadn't also written code that let me shift between tables."
"Once the anagrams started flowing, and I started adding alternate solutions, ARO started taking a long time to compile. Like 30 seconds. So I tried to place in random text and so forth while I built, since that was low-risk for recompiling. I had one rather bad bug which the Inform 6.32 compiler didn't track (http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXcompilersXinform6Xexecutables.html got the new version) but mostly it was just a matter of writing stuff down and feeding it to a computer. It was much more fun procrastination than others. I found stuff to do (book reading) while something compiled, and that made having to raise an in-program constant less unbearable."
"Many of the puzzles just didn't make sense in the first version. But I was able to sort them out by ones that needed to be changed and ones that would be nice to. I found a lot of times I had to let a tester's observation sit for about two weeks before changing something: gee, it'd be nice to..."
"Perhaps the last thing I enjoyed looking up was that my data roughly obeyed both Zipf's and Benford's Law. I put the megachatter table rows and byte totals as data points into a graph at http://benford.jplusplus.org/, and while each looked pretty good by itself, together they gave a very low z-statistic. Zipf's law was a little trickier--the upper and lower halves of the data had different trend lines. I impart this to how I just sort of added a bunch of tables late, so of course those would sink to the bottom. While a few later tables gained traction (posse bosses, lame talk shows and comedians,) many were just neat to get to ten, and I didn't add to them."
"I also found that, by the end, I spent more time adding anagrams than actual bug fixes to Shuffling and Roiling. But it was fun, and I felt I was doing something every day. Still, it got to be time consuming, and it took a while before I figured a way to add stuff to a separate text file, push a button, and add it to source."
"Learned Helplessness is a powerful thing, and you can always be sucked back down into it: there's that silly voice in my head saying 'Haven't you gotten enough shortcuts?' Larry Wall's delightful oversimplification of the three programming virtues has helped me a lot, here, but I think the real way to frame things is: with the tools I have now, X would be too tough. I don't see how to fix it, yet, but I will."
"One thing I wish I'd done earlier, that would've given me more shortcuts, was setting up my GitHub account. The simple graph of what you've done today (green vs. grey) is great motivation to do something/anything, and if it isn't much, that's motivation to do more next time."
"Finally, I'm just grateful I had so much fun exploring so many alleys and polishing so many odd things. I hope you had even half as much fun playing as I did writing the Stale Tales Slate."
