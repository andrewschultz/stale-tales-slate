You talk for a bit, and he talks about how he wants to be a writer and his name is Obert (O-Bert) and you suggest he might be a better writer just by calling himself OB-ert (short o.)

You assure them you are not, that you've got a rather libertarian view on it all, but it takes so long that a joint they left in there burns the store down. Fortunately, they'd grabbed everything else of value, and all things considered, they feel almost glad to be liberated from their fears of being caught.

You stumble out yourself, back onto the way high highway.[paragraph break]'Whoah, dude! You totally stuck it to guard-on-a-ground Durango! Dour nag!' The tokers give you the sauciest suitcase you could imagine (tie-dyed, not spaghetti sauce) and encourage you to eat the nice mush munchies therein.

But what you got helps reduce migraines['] mini-rages, like [if headaches is 10](after some experiments with the settler) [end if]that annoying noise from the slider. You can use the slider [if headaches is 0]again[else]more[end if], now.[paragraph break]Their general partying and babble about wanting to find adventure like yours tires you out.

WOE BOW BELL	Rude N Nuder	false	382326203	--	"below"	"below"	--	post-below rule	"It's worth a shot. You duck below the [sit a nag]. Not actually kneeling, of course, because that would be sort of like bowing. But [Gast] decides, why not join you, just in case? After several minutes, the WOE BOW BELL stops. Perhaps there was a correlation. Perhaps not. But [Gast] has decided to change the subject, pulling out a book labeled Rude [']N Nuder and launching new complaints about how this is what Yorpwald is reduced to these days."
Rude N Nuder	U NERD ENDUR REDUN	true	408172316	--	"under"	"under"	--	post-under rule	"You can't take [Gast] waving the, um, literature around. You look under--the parts [Gast] won't let you see--and you wonder what's the big deal. Disgusted that nobody will listen any more, [Gast] throws Rude [']N Nuder in the air. The slip-on cover rips! It falls away to reveal a different book ... [i]Runner Dude[r], by Nurene Rudd and Derrun Edun. Wait, no! That's another false cover. The book's real title is [b]U NERD: ENDUR (REDUN)[r]! And boy, it is runed.[paragraph break]Well, whoever hid it was clever. Hide something REALLY taboo under something that just gets everyone moderately uncomfortable."

'You can't...'[paragraph break]But you do. It's yucky and squishy, but it's not the seediest seed site ever. You hold your nose, hoping you can find what you want. Suddenly, you feel irrationally happy to find a small plant--you even think 'TO SPUR PO['] RUTS. PORT US!' Yes, it must be a stupor sprout! You take it, leaving the mere pit emptier."

Yes, there's a big hole you can go down. You think you hear a drama armada cheering you: 'Go down now, dog!' ... 'So true, sure to set our ouster...' It's a scented descent, which feels right. It had better be. You hear THE BEAN roll back into place..."
NULL IT unit	odd run on aura	false	375930018	--	"until"	"until"	pre-unlit-until rule	--	"The one preposition gives you confidence you will find No-Lag Logan, and because you're below ground, you fear no sunlit insult. The NULL IT unit fizzles a bit and pops, and light returns to Harms Marsh ... in the form of an odd run on aura![paragraph break]So while the marsh isn't exactly glowing now, you can definitely notice things better. The sheol holes in particular, though some will still ambush you. But which way to go? Compass directions are still out."

data dim mists	data dim mists	false	331668890	Cripple Clipper	"amidst"	"amidst"	--	--	"It's tricky. You don't want to just get through the mist, but you mean to explore everything. And you turn up a bad oar! Then, when you find a ship, it's--well, the bad oar is accepted. 'You found it! You must be the one! I can go now!' It is No-Lag Logan. You protest. You need someone to show you the way! 'You will learn from my impetuousness,' says No-Lag Logan. I needed some weird unusual direction, but I just went ahead and tried any old thing ... and now I have just this Cripple Clipper. It will not work for me, but if you got here, it will work for you."
thickness sketchins	thickness sketchins	false	441136547	Sonancy Canyons	"athwart"	"athwart"	--	post-athwart rule	"Not just any direction will do. You need something nautical. And there it is. Athwart--helps you navigate around tough bits. 'Ahoy, eh? Oh yeah!' you yell, identifying the mast and stuff. You suddenly feel enveloped with all manner of navigational knowledge, and the mess-up spumes popping up everywhere? Well, they are no problem. And though you're in an underground cavern, there are--well, not quite stars, but markers that can help guide you to the free reef, if you need the extra direction.[paragraph break]Harbor! Rah, bro! The bad oar helps you on your way but snaps as you land. You think to yourself, scan yon... so canny... and you wind up somewhere different."
bent ewe	bent ewe	false	681789531	--	"between"	"between"	--	--	"You stand bravely between the hog and the bee. Surprisingly, they don't seem upset. They actually appreciate your company."
raptest patters	raptest patters	false	575888338	--	"without"	"without"	--	--	"It's always tough to figure how to ignore stuff. Do you focus on it directly, to find a way to get rid of it, or do you try to block it out? Either way, you realize that you just want to be without that sort of drivel, and ... amazingly, when you think of the more important things you have to do, it goes away."
hurt hog	hurt hog	false	475056505	--	"through"	"through"	pre-hurt-hog-through rule	post-hurt-hog-through rule	"You realize it's time to move on. So you do. It feels a bit ritualistic and all, but the hurt hog and bent ewe, no longer hurt or bent, move on physically as well. You come upon a yob den nearby. Only your wisdom, or abstract anagram-solving skills, can help you determine whether to visit for a while, or not."
yob den	yob den	false	432873440	Strip of Profits	"beyond"	"beyond"	--	--	"You ignore the yob den. That'll sort itself out later. What's important is to find a way out, back to the surface. And you do... it's much quicker than you'd think! You turn around, and there's the yob den, cheering for you. A drama armada is also there, beneath a ramada, of course. They're applauding you. You realize you're just outside of the poison stripe, and it turns a final shade of bright green before it winks out and vanishes. 'Pardone...a pro end! One, pard!' It's Brother Horbert. 'These other people, well, they promoted me to an Aproned Padrone. I hope I'm up to it. But I know you have other places to be ... thank you... just one more thing?[paragraph break]In private, you help him change a Groans Sarong back to organs, which will spread joy and music and art through Yorpwald. Behind the sarong is a way through Old Warpy. As you enter, you notice No-Lag Logan has joined the crowd waving to you."

"Part one: Protean[paragraph break]There's no compelling personal story here. I just had fun trying to make the sort of game I'd have liked when I was younger, the sort Infocom might've done better if the Apple didn't have its limitations.[paragraph break]This part maps how ARO was part of Shuffling Around at first, til I realized that'd be too long for IFComp's two hours. You see how the game started with the stores, how there was F, I, U, V, W and Y, with P being the finale, and how store M didn't exist for a while. In fact, Store R got finished at the very last. It relates how OUTSIDE was the original puzzle until the author realized that was too abstruse, thanks to a tester, and it maps how F and I were first, so they go the good stuff--the nouns--before M started developing. Somewhere along the line, too, I decided to go in for an anagram of Psuedonym. Moe Spudny, Spud Money, Don Muspey and Ed Spumony all seemed amusing, but it wasn't until I remembered a character I wrote for a walkthrough of Deathlord, Ned, that I started poking around. Yompus may not be a real last name, but it sounds like one. So I went with it. Finding it was one of those 'click' moments that didn't solve any technical problems, but it felt cool.[paragraph break]Plus, the best I found for Andrew Schultz was CRAWLS, ZEN, THUD, until Hanon Ondricek pointed out (in 2014) Dawn Churlzest worked, too."
"Part two: Wrapt to[paragraph break]I realized that it was probably best to go with nouns-to-nouns. Well, until the last puzzle. This kicked out all but F and I. I didn't know what else to do, or where the finale would be. I eventually decided on R, once I figured a resort would be a good place. It only had the Means Manse, and you just had to EXIST. I think your enemy was Too-Apt Pa Otto, and you had to make him into a POTATO. But that was a bit mean. Then METROS began to take shape, and I liked the underside and hotel, and then other locations fell into place."
"Part three: Trap there? Er, phatter[paragraph break]The big problem I had was that I couldn't disambiguate how to flip items, and I had no encouragement for guesses for anagrams. This was a pretty big fault, and there were others, too. Nevertheless, I found a lot with the help of my testers, and I even had the bright idea of trying to provide an alternate way through Metros. One sub-try got the player stuck. Nevertheless, I was able to identify ways to take care of this throughout the comp, and I had plans for post-release stuff. Every mistake I made served to give me an idea to make things easier for the player. The game needed it. I also settled on the idea for the new hint device. I didn't want to reuse what I had from SA, but I also wanted to make things simpler and more powerful. People had trouble seeing if they could take both devices, so I merged them. And I started on the settler, once people said they wanted something a bit more Master Mind like."
"Part four: tap furor[paragraph break]Nobody was really furious at the game, but I certainly got to work when I learned about David White's hashing. Immediately it made ARO more accessible, in theory. I had a lot to whip into shape. I tried to fix a few things per day. I was disappointed in the bigger mistakes I made, and after getting SA into a decent beta (or so I thought,) I started on ARO."
"Part five: pave rift[paragraph break]The only problem was, once I got back to ARO, it didn't make sense. I had an idea that nouns would only feature in the intro. Oyster was just entering a house and leaving. Routes didn't let you underground. Troves--well, I didn't get the concept of what it should be in the first release, though I had a few passive verbs. I had to look through my master document of anagrams, and I found that a lot I dismissed as too simple wound up fitting just right, and testers particularly liked them. I also figured on interjections for Presto as the last area, because interjections are EXCITING. Towers--well, more on that later. I also wasn't sure what to do with OTHERS, which I had after the Ordeal Reload and before the strip. I eventually decided to chuck it for release 1, as it wasn't as good an introduction as I thought. The diorama was created 2 weeks before 2013 Spring Thing, and I think it was relatively successful. But I left so much to do at the last minute with exiling a region I'd worked on that I missed some big things."
"Part six: star pix[paragraph break]I had hoped to put graphics into the game, and it turned out trickier than I thought. Thankfully Glimmr for Glulx works pretty well, but I would up losing valuable time not using the fonts correctly, due to a dumb mistake. I also failed to stop a buffer overrun in some cases, but that's another story. This was something automation could not catch. I also experimented with some pictures and colored text (Yorpwald/wordplay) but didn't get cover art. I couldn't think of anything simple."
"Part seven: vaster pen[paragraph break]The big problem, though, was what to do with Towers. Originally they were a mess of anagrams like STANCH and CHANTS you had to guess, and you got clues of what was where, and some choices were good and some were evil, and you hacked through the Thickest Thickets. One guy, Elmer, was good, and Merle was evil, and the (then-)Coevals['] Alcoves had an elevator where you could go to the various floors and try puzzles. I liked this when OYSTER was small, but Oyster started getting bigger, and Towers became too abstruse with its actions.[paragraph break]It did have hinting, though, and this hinting eventually got repurposed more powerfully and elementally to the settler, but until then, it was a mess. I figured adjectives would be the trickiest things to look at, but a look through my master document gave a lot. At least they weren't as bad as adverbs. I couldn't do anything with them, right? Adverbs were so--powerless."
"Part eight: that gripe, gather pit, tiger path[paragraph break]And that's when it hit me--I could just GREP my anagram file for ly\b, or words that end in LY, and of course you could be powerless near your great foe. The Bleary Barley came first, then a way to regain your powers--conjunctions were another word that could be very powerful. Then I noticed a slew of animals which hadn't been anagrammed, mostly because I didn't see how to in SA without crowding the game. Things started to click. I even had an enemy to defeat, but she had no character or name. The necro-crone wasn't Elvira til after Spring Thing."
"Part nine: inert nap, pain rent[paragraph break]I was able to get the game working with a walkthrough, and I submitted it okay. Greg Boettcher noted it worked, and he liked the idea, though he diplomatically noted that the walkthrough's cuing helped (translated, this meant I forgot to cue SEVERAL exits.) I found a few easy bugs post-release and didn't see any reviews for a while. I was at least glad one liked the pedanto-notepad. But I was still frustrated. I was grateful to place second to a very entertaining game (Geoff Moore and I have since helped each other with other works,) and I knew I wanted a post-release fix, but I didn't know the scope. What probably kicked me in the butt was an email from someone named Toby Ott who thanked me for the game. He explained he was blind and liked games like this, but he'd found a few bugs. This moved me from 'I better fix my mistakes' to 'I can make this better for people who like this sort of thing.' I also saw a very good walkthrough with bug reports from David Welbourn. I was happy to note I'd fixed some of the bugs, but he provided cuing beyond the good stuff my testers found, including some help-code that hung the game. I think what they found helped him be able to find stuff without getting TOO frustrated. But again, it was nice people were PLAYING."
"Part ten: pet rant pattern[paragraph break]I thought I'd get the first release out before IFComp 2013, but there were always new bugs to find or puzzles to touch up. I'd fix an area, then move to the next, then be sure the area was paved over smoothly--only to find several 'I saw that, right?' issues. The thing was, there was so much I needed to do, I couldn't get down to the fun aesthetic stuff in good conscience. Eventually I decided on a drop-dead release date early in 2014, but unfortunately I couldn't get to some good transcripts. I left some huge bugs in--ones my testers found--but release 2 made a lot more sense."
"Part eleven: nerve leapt. Vent. Repeal[paragraph break]One of the huge problems I had with testing was the inefficiency of adding one anagram. But with the major issues out of the way, I found ways to do stuff better. How to add names to anagram checking. This caused my bookshelf to add 1000 titles for release 3 and let me name all the authors. I found a way to centralize all the anagram tables so you could see them at the end. I thought I wouldn't use it much, but I wound up adding ten tables more. I used Notepad++ to load quickly and add anagrams when I didn't need to compile, and for my own vanity, I tracked the number of anagrams in the randomized tables and even checked if they conformed to Benford's Law and Zipf's Law. I wrote an anagram-checker. PERL even helped me to detect bad punctuation, capitals or quotes. All this helped me focus on technical stuff. There's so much I thought I'd only use once, but I reused it. All sorts of internal checks (like the tables of anagrams and David White's hashes--in some cases, I wasn't checking right) cleared up. The Table of Nudges grew by several hundreds as I wrote a program to check for the hash value and dump it in a text file for later use. I even managed to write a silly program to check the relative difficulties of the areas. Towers is, by far, the toughest. But I think the most important thing I did was to try and play through one or two areas seriously per week. I needed to let testers['] suggestions soak in. Some puzzles, I thought, weren't perfect, but I didn't have better. But I would up cleaning them up later."
"Part twelve: twerp valet varlet wept[paragraph break]It turns out there's nothing here that was any good, but I liked this sentence."
"Part thirteen: inert? Phatter! Prettier than...[paragraph break]Just having time pass and being able to tighten up puzzles and think of things has been revealing. I write down my notes, look them over, and get on with it. I've never worked as hard at a creative project as I did with this game, but so many times I thought I'd run out of things to do before finding one more. While I figured 'Demo dome mode' shortly before release 2, I never got around to it because there was always something else in the game."
"Final part: plan a rift[paragraph break]I'll have to move on. I had fun with this game as a thought experiment. I enjoyed looking at a phrase, saying I bet that'll anagram, and being right. I also enjoyed finding that a simple anagram could fit nicely in the game's flow. But it all has a diminishing return to scale. I want to move on, but hopefully I'll be able to add new silly books or dialogue on a whim. Github makes it easy to add things--and I wish I'd had it earlier, so I could've tracked other changes. Oh, and if people find bugs (still) I can roll that up, too."

"A chunk of code starting with CheckTranscriptStatus (courtesy of Zarf) notes how the author was able to nag his testers to take a transcript if they left a comment without transcripting on--or to thank them."
"You read various testing commands used in writing the game, including ones to show the exits every move, hint everything visible every move, and track hints without spoiling things for the player. Other commands include jumping to the Strip of Profits, clearing all but Otters, and even jumping to just before the Gates Stage."
"You stare at the start of the Tables of Nudges. There's, like, 1000+! That's over double Shuffling Around! The numbers look confusing and arbitrary, but you recognize the anagram-strings that the game checks for, as well as how room anagrams seem to point to the same error messages. You even see how they were broken into regions, and a region has a table name called table of routes anagrams/nudges, and so forth."
"You stare at the start of the Table of Random Books. Wow, [number of rows in table of random books]! That's a lot of books! The second column seems to give a book a priority, so the player is likely to see certain ones first. Those seem to cover certain puzzles that occur later. It seems like a lot, but there's a note that it was well over two years, and the author just wrote a few neat words from each book to poke at."
"You see some specialized Inform 6 code from Zarf (again,) Climbing Stars (in more than one place--for disabling TRACE for the Oyster puzzle, and for restarting the game after winning) and other people."
"You see a bit more Inform 6 code the author scratched out himself. The main chunk is at https://www.intfic.com/t/i6-stubs-for-i7-programmers/83/6."
"You read more various miscellaneous testing commands, like ones that zap all the guardians, see all the fruits or even show what the player would've missed or alternate paths every move."
"You stare at the various tables of random text. A voice from behind a fourth wall mentions they used to be in lists, and worse, not even alphabetized so that some duplicates could be caught easily."

"There's a reference to http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=17095 which describes how to detect orphan text in Inform source."
"The perl code is a bit complex, but it seems to involve reducing strings to smaller things. #Mega Mage Game = a3e3g3m3."

"Below the code for reducing strings are various comparisons to detect if an anagram has been used, if a book anagram is proper, or if the book matches its author(s)."
"In the book/author notes, there's a few comments about 70% had matching names before the try, and 10% just had bad anagrams, before that was all fixed. And many former author names were shipped off to Shuffling Around to make room for new ones here."
"while ($a = <A>) { if (($a =~ /@ARGV[bracket]0[close bracket]/) && ($a =~ /@ARGV[bracket]1[close bracket]/)) { print '$a matches.'; } } # simple check for if I wrote something already"
"There's simpler code below just detecting if any anagrams are found in table entries. It's tough to follow, with exceptions for if two of the same word are in an entry, with the same hash as above."
"There's code of what appears to be copying critical files to a GitHub directory. Shuffling Around and Roiling files are sent to sister directories, along with the compiled release binaries and piles of odd utilities."
"The rest is too archaic, but it includes other things I put on [ghsite] include scripts to verify random text anagrams, to create the cheat and non-cheat text in the settler, and even track geometric means of table lengths."

table of observations
thistext [from chic loner chronicle] [tdm4]
"I found so many ridiculous anagrams just reading a book on the way to work, or working out, and then I'd just feed them into the anagram server. If ten thousand seems like a lot, well, that is over two years, so that is fifteen per day. That is not so bad when you consider one takes a minute, and I can waste a lot of time in any case."
"One of the best parts of using the anagram server was that I kept seeing cool quotes on the right. These added up to ideas for future games, or even funny jokes, or even more authors to read. It's always a treat when one project gives you spin-off projects."
"A simple I <3 BLOCKSITE FOR FIREFOX. AND GOOGLE CHROME. Well, that's not very philosophical or motivational, but it could be practical."
"It's difficult to describe when an idea has critical weight to branch out. For things like the responses to waiting or blank commands, I maybe had a few in one of/or loops, until I sat down and concentrated on words that meant doing nothing. It took a while to find, but once I had, say, six, I sat down and tried to stretch it to ten, when I put it in a table for the player to see at the end."
"Many of my ideas come from everyday things. I didn't pay religious attention to my file of anagrams once I put down the initial puzzles. However, having two testers say, this seemed a bit wobbly, got me thinking. There were puzzles I liked, and I recruited the best talent available, so to speak. But like on a sports team, the most impressive athlete doesn't necessarily fit. It was hard to retire favorite anagrams or demote them, but it was necessary. And I got some good mileage with ones I'd passed up because I thought I had enough good ones. The diners in release 3 are probably the best example of this."
"It wasn't until I established an assembly line for writing things up that I really started getting the anagrams in place. Before, I sent things to my daily writing, which sorted ideas to a big file by region. Once I cemented ARO as a big project to dedicate time to directly, I didn't have that hurdle, and things went faster."
"I'm still amazed how much organization helped me. Before, I might see an anagram and wonder where it went. Once I organized the anagram types into the Table of Megachatter, it became a lot clearer what would go where, and I could add a new category if I wanted. The one of/or constructions--where things cycled every three times you observed--billowed out to tables. As did lists, where it was tough just to insert one idea. I figured how to make a final note, too, before cycling."
"I even found it easy to add new or break-off tables. For instance, the schematic catechism (one of the last anagrams I wanted to do something with but I didn't know what) originally just had random ideas. Then it had research topics. Then it had Brainy People. Again, none of this would've happened if I hadn't also written code that let me shift between tables."
"Once the anagrams started flowing, and I started adding alternate solutions, ARO started taking a long time to compile. Like 30 seconds. So I tried to place in random text and so forth while I built, since that was low-risk for recompiling. I had one rather bad bug which the Inform 6.32 compiler didn't track (http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXcompilersXinform6Xexecutables.html got the new version) but mostly it was just a matter of writing stuff down and feeding it to a computer. It was much more fun procrastination than others. I found stuff to do (book reading) while something compiled, and that made having to raise an in-program constant less unbearable."
"Many of the puzzles just didn't make sense in the first version. But I was able to sort them out by ones that needed to be changed and ones that would be nice to. I found a lot of times I had to let a tester's observation sit for about two weeks before changing something: gee, it'd be nice to..."
"Perhaps the last thing I enjoyed looking up was that my data roughly obeyed both Zipf's and Benford's Law. I put the megachatter table rows and byte totals as data points into a graph at http://benford.jplusplus.org/, and while each looked pretty good by itself, together they gave a very low z-statistic. Zipf's law was a little trickier--the upper and lower halves of the data had different trend lines. I impart this to how I just sort of added a bunch of tables late, so of course those would sink to the bottom. While a few later tables gained traction (posse bosses, lame talk shows and comedians,) many were just neat to get to ten, and I didn't add to them."
"I also found that, by the end, I spent more time adding anagrams than actual bug fixes to Shuffling and Roiling. But it was fun, and I felt I was doing something every day. Still, it got to be time consuming, and it took a while before I figured a way to add stuff to a separate text file, push a button, and add it to source."
"Learned Helplessness is a powerful thing, and you can always be sucked back down into it: there's that silly voice in my head saying 'Haven't you gotten enough shortcuts?' Larry Wall's delightful oversimplification of the three programming virtues has helped me a lot, here, but I think the real way to frame things is: with the tools I have now, X would be too tough. I don't see how to fix it, yet, but I will."
"One thing I wish I'd done earlier, that would've given me more shortcuts, was setting up my GitHub account. The simple graph of what you've done today (green vs. grey) is great motivation to do something/anything, and if it isn't much, that's motivation to do more next time."
"Finally, I'm just grateful I had so much fun exploring so many alleys and polishing so many odd things. I hope you had even half as much fun playing as I did writing the Stale Tales Slate."

red writing	"The red writing provides a clue of what the letters can't be."
pedanto notepad	"You can CONSULT the notepad about things. It contains no game-critical hints, but it can help you remember a lot of shortcuts and such, so you can think sharper."
a rich chair	"[if player does not have notepad]You can take the pedanto-notepad from the rich chair, for starters[else if latches are not off-stage]The/a rich chair hid the latches. You have them now[else]You can SEARCH a rich chair to find something, though it will turn up in the course of play anyway[end if]."
Report Porter Perrot	"You can pump [perrot] for information if you want."
isolani liaison	"The isolani liaison is just a door. It isn't there for any puzzles but just to communicate with the outside world[if Report Porter Perrot is not off-stage]. But after taking to Report Porter Perrot, it's not useful[end if]."
notice	"For reading."
beams	"[one of]It's important there are TEN BEAMS.[plus][or]The ten beams lead somewhere below.[plus][or]What is a place that's below in a house?[plus][or]Open the BASEMENT.[minus][cycling]"
question mark	"[if player has inducted deductin][deductin] has more detailed information on how to read a question mark.[line break][else if inducted deductin is off-stage]There'll be a hint item later that explains how to sort out ambiguous readings from the settler in cheat mode.[line break][else][end if][one of]A question mark in cheat mode for the settler is not as hopeless as you'd think. In fact, it may cut down the possibilities. It may occur when there are two possible solutions or, more likely, when something to change has a double-anagram, e.g. TAPES SPATE, a matching anagram, or MERE MOOR, which is (EMOR) times two.[plus][or]So if you have an eight-letter word, an ambiguous reading may leave two possibilities, but a vowel or consonant may turn up four. Thus, an ambiguous reading works out better.[plus][or]You can also switch to non-cheat mode to clear up ambiguities, but often, you don't need to. I'll use the TAPES SPATE sample below.[plus][or]If TAPES SPATE gives R?R??, we have a good bit to work with. The first letter must be P, since it is a consonant.[plus][or]The second letter must be A. This is the sort of jump that makes cheat mode with ambiguity powerful. Slot 3 must be a consonant, and slots 4 or 5 can be E or a consonant. That leaves A for slot 2.[plus][or]However, for the end bit, there is ambiguity. E can go in slot 4 or 5.[plus][or]You thus have PATES or PASTE, so TAPES SPATE is potentially ambiguous. No critical puzzles will be in A Roiling Original. But you can also see how ambiguous readings can drastically cut down possibilities.[minus][cycling]"
colorful logo	"The logo provides hints as to the mechanics of the settler. You may want to try examining it with teach/cheat mode on or off."
whichs shwich	"[one of]The whichs shwich button toggles whether or not you know characters are in the right position. Details on what the colors mean will follow if you HINT again.[plus][or]More specifically, red/yellow=wrong, purple/green=right.[minus][cycling]"
decal	"[one of]The Y's on the decal are orange. This seems like a clue.[plus][or]Orange is red and yellow.[plus][or]Y is the only letter of the alphabet that is...[plus][or]...a consonant and a vowel![minus][cycling]"
backside	--	laced decal
slider	"The slider will allow you more detailed hints about how close a guess is. But it has limited uses."
receptors	"Electricity is beyond me. But the rest of the settler could help you."
a tech etcha	"[one of]The/a tech etcha['] can be switched to vary the level of hinting. Cheat/teach on potentially gives more. Some NPCs may [if strip of profits is visited]have helped[else]help[end if] you with it, but if you want the quick spoilers, HINT again.[plus][or]A tech etcha['] shows different readings for certain letters. In some cases, the readings are ambiguous, but usually, they aren't.[plus][or]A tech etcha['] may cause some entries to be purple or green instead of red or yellow.[plus][or]The tech etcha['] adds blue in some cases.[plus][or]If a letter is in the right spot, the/a tech etcha['] adds blue. Red + blue = purple for consonants. Yellow + blue = green for vowels.[plus][or]Undefined settings indicate one or more, but not all, letters in a compound anagram are right, but not both.[plus][or]A simple example would be EAST SEAT going to TEAS. Letters 2 and 3 would give question marks. For a full explanation of how this could help you, HINT QUESTION MARK.[minus][cycling]"

palm	"[one of]Well, you need a light source, but a palm [b]absorbs[r] light.[plus][or]It wouldn't be bright to stumble into the palm...[plus][or]...but changing the palm would be.[plus][or]If you wait around, you get some hints of what to do with the palm.

lamp	"The lamp will last as long as you need it to."

You'll see some, err, patterns.[else]Report Porter Perrot's chat contained a good many things.[end if][plus][or]You had the ability to flip objects into anagrams of each other. This game shows a different side to that power.[minus][cycling]"
meet bans	"[one of]The ten beams guard something downstairs. What?[plus][or]The number of beams is important.[plus][or]What's a common downstairs place in any house?[plus][or]The beams guard a BASEMENT.[minus][cycling]"

chimney	"You can CLIMB the chimney or go up it."
stair	"You can go up or down the stair."

sitar	"[one of]You need a way down, but the sitar doesn't allow that.[plus][or]Rearrange two letters in sitar.[plus][or]The sitar becomes a stair.[minus][cycling]"
stria	"[one of]Embedded in the ceiling, the stria split it a bit. Maybe they offer a way up?[plus][or]The stria can become a STAIR.[minus][cycling]"
pram	"[one of]The pram gives you a sinking feeling to look at it.[plus][or]You need a way down and out of reach. Something you could even crawl down.[plus][or]The pram can become a ramp.[minus][cycling]"
ramp	"Just go down or in to walk down the ramp."
latches	"[one of]The latches seem useless, but they are your parting gift from [gtmn][if Largely All Grey Gallery is visited], so you probably want to 'solve' them before moving on[end if].[plus][or][if treatise is off-stage]You should examine the latches. There's a note inside them which is useful.[else][gtmn] also said it would be pretty simple to figure out what to do with the latches.[end if][plus][or]Did you notice anything about the treatise's wording that might give a hint about the latches?[plus][or]Lots of anagrams in the treatise, but they have something in common.[plus][or][gtmn] only switched the first and last letters in the treatise. Maybe you can do that with the latches.[plus][or]You can get a SATCHEL.[minus][cycling]"
satchel	"The satchel might be useful for carrying things, but your super purse is better. So don't worry about it."
letters settler	"[one of]The settler seems to give mostly reds and yellows. If you tinker with it, you may notice a pattern.[plus][or]Reds mean one thing and yellows mean another. If you've solved and scanned a bit, you may know which is what.[plus][or]Also, the coloring of the words LETTERS SETTLER is a clue. If you have the teach/cheat button on.[plus][or]As is, to get fourth-wall, A ROILING ORIGINAL.[plus][or]But the settler is all you need.[plus][or]With teach/cheat on, note that e-t-t are halfway different colors. That's because they match.[plus][or]Specifically, if the current object differs from the target object in one letter, the color will be red if the target is a consonant and yellow if it's a vowel.[plus][or]If you have 'cheat' on, you can see that green is a correct vowel and purple is a correct consonant. Red and yellow are incorrect consonants and vowels.[plus][or]There are also orange and brown, but they are rarer. Since orange = red + yellow, you can guess what it may be.[plus][or]The letter Y.[plus][or]There should be a separate document describing basic strategies for using the settler.[plus][or]One last thing: the equals sign is there so as not to spoil puzzles that are a bit on the easy side. It's fully optional and just part of what I hope is something that helps calibrate play to be more fun based on how tough you find these sorts of puzzles.[minus][cycling]"
diorama	"[one of]The diorama provides things you can flip around. You don't get any points for them, since they're labeled, but I hope they help.[plus][or]First, the platform and pavement give only reds and yellows, even in teach/cheat mode. Cheat mode doesn't help.[plus][or]What pattern do you see in reds and yellow on the diorama?[plus][or]The crabgrass and pedestal have colors that change in some places.[plus][or]Note the colors change from red to purple or yellow to green. What is similar about these?[plus][or]Adding blue. And which letters change?[plus][or]cRAbgrass, bRAss crag.[plus][or]The letters that are correct![plus][or]So, blue = correct.[minus][cycling]"
equals sign	"[one of]The equals sign is useful if you don't want things to be too easy.[plus][or]The equals sign will give squealings if you scan something and the information might make the puzzle trivial.[plus][or]You can override the equals sign with SY (scan with correct letters) or SN.[line break][sy-sn][minus][cycling]"
ISBN Bins	"[if isbn bins are reflexed]You figured how to secure the ISBN bins. Nothing more to do.[else][one of]The ISBN Bins are pretty hefty, but they're easy to enter.[plus][or]Maybe you could add a bit of security before leaving. Not that you need to. But if you want all the points...[plus][or]It's an unusual word, but then, there are only twenty-four of them.[plus][or]You can make a SNIB.[minus][cycling][end if]"
teariest treatise	"[one of]The treatise describes how to use the settler.[plus][or]The treatise cuts off near the end, but the first paragraph gives enough hints.[plus][or]The treatise provides information on what to change the latches to, as well as what's beyond.[minus][cycling]"
super purse	"[one of]The super purse can't be changed, but it's there to circumvent some common adventuring tropes.[plus][or]The purse is a bit of a catch-all, so your huge inventory seems reasonable. It hides what you don't need nicely, and it shows what you do.[minus][cycling]"
evac cave	"The evac-cave is your way out[if Elmo is touchable] once you get rid of Elmo[end if]."
rifle	"[one of]The rifle's more powerful than words. OR IS IT.[plus][or]The rifle makes you wonder if you're on a wanted poster or something.[plus][or]The rifle can become a much more harmless FLIER.[minus][cycling]"

Spelling is important. But you can do more.[plus][or]The specter may give more information about ambiguous readings if you scan it different ways.[minus][cycling]"

act ruin curtain	"[one of]What does the act-ruin curtain--with its design--remind you of?[plus][or]The act-ruin curtain is meant to look like lined paper. The sort of essay paper you might procrastinate for a class. Hence why it stops you from acting. The holes in the upper corner look like they were made by a stapler.[plus][or][if plaster is touchable or plates are touchable]You've got some work to do before you can do any stapling[else]You've got what you need to staple the curtain and peel it back[end if].[plus][or]STAPLE CURTAIN[if staple is not in stapler] once you've put everything together[end if].[minus][cycling]"

Now, what to do with it?[else]Curtis [up-to-l3].[end if]"
Mole Elmo	"Mole Elmo's not a very enthusiastic captor. It's as if he wants you to do something to the rifle."
high sign	"[one of]3, 4, 1, 2, 5. What do those numbers mean?[plus][or]The rifle has five letters, so that is a clue.[plus][or]Letter 3, letter 4, letter 1, letter 2, letter 5.[plus][or]3-4-1-2-5 of rifle.[plus][or]Elmo is cluing the rifle can become a FLIER.[minus][cycling]"	[end ORDEAL RELOAD hints]
sad ads	"Err, mostly anagrams that couldn't fit into puzzles. I hope you find them amusing."
Store B	"[one of]Store B contains some sort of mystery food, but people seem too lazy to figure it out.[plus][or]The two names provide red-clues, but you can also tell from the smells from Store B.[plus][or]SORBET.[minus][cycling]"
Store H	"[one of]If you haven't solved the game proper, you won't be able to get into Store H.[plus][or]Store H appears radically different from the rest of the store. It's probably where stuff that doesn't fit in goes.[plus][or]ES Roth mentions that you can't face the hoster or call it directly.[plus][or]What's a word for stuff sluffed off to the side?[plus][or]OTHERS. If you want the quick way through, you will need to restart the game.[plus][or]You need to [b]ROVE OVER[r] when you are in the Means Manse.[minus][cycling]"
Store K	"[one of]Store K is not critical, because it's a bit of American slang.[plus][or]What is the suspicious smelling smoke?[plus][or]The smoke is marijuana, but STONER doesn't quite work on Store N.[plus][or]The residents of Store K want to REST, OK? That hint knocks out the vowels with the settler.[plus][or]Also, they yell don't have a STROKE![plus][or]You can also assume they are plural, so S is last.[plus][or]They are TOKERS.[minus][cycling]"
Store N	"[one of]Looks like there's a guy in Store N. You need to figure his name.[plus][or]Items fall out of Store N if you keep poking or examining.[plus][or]The toners/Sterno give a lot of clues.[plus][or]The mythology and Tintin clue may tip you off.[plus][or]NESTOR is his name.[minus][cycling]"
toners	"The bottle of toners, being red, helps cut down the name of the person in Store N."
Store P	"[one of]You seem to need a magic word, and the tropes poster plus Store P give you a few hints.[plus][or]In particular, you see two blinking colors, which means the first two letters are P/T O/R.[plus][or]But the second must be a consonant. Also, TROPES means you know where the vowels are.[plus][or]Process of elimination gives PRESTO.[minus][cycling]"
tropes poster	--	Store P
Store T	"[one of]Cute squeaky noises from burrows in Store T. There must be many such animals. As if there's some animal that this industrial buildup has displaced.[plus][or]There are four choices left, if you use the settler, but what is a riverside animal?[plus][or]OTTERS.[minus][cycling]"
Store U	"[one of]The roads in Store U. What's another word for that? They're numbered, too.[plus][or]The settler's a big help here, as it knocks out the vowel. Then you can try where T should go. Or better yet, you can guess that whatever it is is plural, and that knocks things out logically.[plus][or]Not just any old roads but ones with signs for bus stops, etc.[plus][or]ROUTES.[minus][cycling]"
roads	--	Store U
Store V	"[one of]You see sparkling inside Store V if you look at the right angle. Well, several angles.[plus][or]Hmm, treasures. Where do you find treasures? (Word-logic clues follow before the solution.)[plus][or]If you use the settler, you can figure which vowels are where.[plus][or]Then you can figure the first letter, since you have CCVCVC, and many two-consonant combinations don't work well to start.[plus][or]You should wind up with TROVES.[minus][cycling]"
voters	"You can scan the voters if you can't figure what Store V should be."
Store W	"[one of]You may wish to look at the description of Store W, though RESTOW also allows a clue.[plus][or]Store W seems taller than the other stores, like it has several levels.
